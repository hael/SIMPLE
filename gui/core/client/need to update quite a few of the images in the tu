need to update quite a few of the images in the tutorial so they start from the correct job

mask size needs updating - ??? 100 pixels (120A radius)
box size in manual pick


import project to GUI mode - read simple file???

combine simple project files

import task to new project?????


copy jobs between projects


autopick - have option to only pick small subset of movies for a test -  ideally spaced over defoucus range

the old radius versus diameter, pixels versus angstroms thing


#change Save Clusters to Export Averages

845787.htmlfiletab -default output location and file name
#view3D broken on mac (view 2D works fine)
FSC curve - add on 0.5 and 0.143

volume display doesn't look right in tutorial
path to mask probably not right
re-select clusters in ini3D projection matching window
