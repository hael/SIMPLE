Development with Eclipse IDE
------------------------------

1) Configure your eclipse workspace for your maven repository (if necessary).

   mvn -Declipse.workspace=/path/to/workspace eclipse:configure-workspace

2) Create eclipse project:

   mvn eclipse:eclipse

3) Import the project to the eclipse workspace. Run 'mvn package' to copy
   required resources to target directory. If the dependencies in maven
   project change then the previous step needs to be repeated for updating
   the eclipse project.
