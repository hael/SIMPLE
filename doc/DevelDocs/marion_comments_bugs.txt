SIMPLE should print an error code when an incorrect format is used for parameters (e.g. a space after '=').

CTFFIND
pspecz parameter is not optional
Can run manually but not with the ctrl file

Prime2D/Prime3D
When running 'ctf not equal to no', it should be stated that the deftab parameters are required and not optional. SIMPLE should be killed if the deftab parameters are missing and display an error message.
Right now SIMPLE just complains in the output, askings for deftab in addition to the parameters that are already in the deftab file (kv, cs, fraca - which are not required for SIMPLE to run if the deftab file is input).

Deftab file: there should be a check of the number of lines (right now Prime3D runs anyway even with a wrong deftab and gives weird results)
