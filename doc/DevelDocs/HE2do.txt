random selection of images for prime2D init need to take state=0 into account

need to have another go at the picker
weighted multi-resolution state sorting by fitting B-factors?
per-particle convergence for accelerated analysis?
test specscore on cavgs
rec_asym must be written out in ini3D when srch_symaxis=true
make distributed flow for scale that operates on split stacks so that scaling can be done in parallel

# unidoc points
everything written to cwd
same naming convention for picker as for others
consider auto in name for autoboxes
put in absolute paths whenever files are written out
ctfres put back in
nptcls_per_movie in unidoc

I've pushed the latest version of the gui for you to critique the theme. I think I've incorporated all of the things we discussed. There are a few things still to add such as:
    history auto update
    file identifier on files view page
    3D refinement task
    advanced tasks

You can run up to extract but here I keep getting an error:

>>> DONE PROCESSING PARAMETERS
At line 303 of file simple_utils/simple_filehandling.f90
Fortran runtime error: Index '0' of dimension 1 of array 'pos' below lower bound of 1

I get this whether I give a unitab, unitab + boxtab, filetab + boxtab. 
I will also need to make a few changes to utilize the full path names.

stack check scaling
