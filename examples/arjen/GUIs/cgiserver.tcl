# cgiserver.tcl --
#     A tiny CGI/HTTP server useful for simple applications
#     Derived from the tiny CGI server - http://wiki.tcl.tk/16867
#     This was derived from "DustMotePlus"
#     The server supports a small fraction of the CGI/HTTP standard only
#
#     Purpose:
#     - Present HTML files
#     - Run programs via a simple protocol (no need to know
#       much about CGI)
#
#     Usage:
#         tclsh cgiserver.tcl ?-cfg configuration-file?
#
#     Features:
#     - You can show static HTML pages (requested URL ends in .html)
#     - You can run Tcl scripts (requested URL ends in .tcl) that
#       print the result on standard output and then finish
#     - You can run programs (URL ends in .exe) that use the simple
#       protocol exemplified in "cgi.f90" (see also below)
#
#     TODO: use cgi-bin/* instead of the extension
#
#     The configuration file can specify:
#     - root      The root directory of the application (default: startup directory)
#     - default   The start-up page (default: index.html)
#     - port      Port to be used (default: 80)
#     - encoding  The encoding of the data sent to the client (default: iso8859-1)
#
#     What configuration file:
#     - If the configuration file is not specified on the command-line
#       via "-cfg name", then a file cgiserver.cfg is sought in the
#       current directory.
#     - If it does not exist, the internal defaults are used
#
#     Protocol:
#     The protocol implemented for executable programs (URL: *.exe)
#     is very simple:
#     - The program is started and fed the key-value pairs from the
#       request (on standard input). To dinstinguish requests, lines
#       with %BEGIN% and %END%
#       are added.
#     - The program must write its results to a file "cgiout" and on
#       completion of that file, create a file "cgiready".
#     - The server program takes care of all the rest.
#     The reason for using an external file and not standard output
#     is that there is no buffering problem then and the end of the
#     processing is very clear-cut. That way the program can run in
#     a loop waiting for new requests.
#
#     Known limitations:
#     - The protocol is very simple, it does not cope well with text
#       from a textarea control
#     - No support for multiple instances of the same program at the
#       moment (this requires directory and process management)
#       This means among other things, that the output may get
#       confused if more than process is running at the same time
#     - No checking of the incoming connections, you can do this
#       however by redefining the "answer" procedure in the
#       configuration file
#     - On Windows, if you start this script with wish or a similar
#       shell, the server socket will not be closed properly when
#       terminating the server.
#
#     Ideas for improvements:
#     - Run Tcl scripts in their own interpreter, instead of a separate
#       process?
#     - Add some logging facilities?
#     - Present a graphical screen if Tk is available?
#
#     Note:
#     This server is not intended to become a full-fledged HTTP/CGI
#     server system a la Apache or AOLserver. Only the simplest
#     processing options are implemented.
