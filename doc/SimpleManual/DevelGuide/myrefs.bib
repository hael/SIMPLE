	Abstract = {In yeast, the multisubunit SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase) complex acts as a coactivator to recruit the TATA-binding protein (TBP) to the TATA box, a critical step in eukaryotic gene regulation. However, it is unclear which SAGA subunits are responsible for SAGA's direct interactions with TBP and precisely how SAGA recruits TBP to the promoter. We have used chemical crosslinking to identify Spt8 and Ada1 as potential SAGA subunits that interact with TBP, and we find that both Spt8 and SAGA bind directly to TBP monomer in competition with TBP dimer. We further find that Spt8 and SAGA compete with DNA to bind TBP rather than forming a triple complex. Our results suggest a handoff model for SAGA recruitment of TBP: instead of binding together with TBP at the TATA box, activator-recruited SAGA transfers TBP to the TATA box. This simple model can explain SAGA's observed ability to both activate and repress transcription.},

	Abstract = {Using a combination of ion exchange and immunoaffinity chromatography we have purified the general transcription initiation factor TFIID to near homogeneity from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Yeast TFIID is composed of TBP, the TATA box binding protein, and 14 distinct TBP-associated factors (TAFs), which range in size from 17 to 150 kDa. Twelve of the TAF subunits have been previously identified, but two, TAF48p and TAF65p, are novel. TAF48p exhibits significant sequence similarity to the conserved C-terminal region of Drosophila TAF110p, human TAF130p, and human TAF105p and is encoded by a previously identified gene MPT1. TAF65p shows no significant sequence homology to any previously identified TAFp. The genes encoding TAF48p and TAF65p are single copy and essential for normal yeast cell growth. Furthermore, neither TAF48p nor TAF65p are associated with the histone acetylase Spt-Ada-Gcn5 complex or other non-TFIID TBF.TAF complexes. The significance of these results in terms of TFIID structure, function, and organization is discussed.},

A CTD-less RNA Pol II is unable to support transcription in yeast extracts, but basal transcription reactions reconstituted from highly purified general transcription factors are CTD-independent. To reconcile these two findings, we have taken a biochemical approach using yeast extracts and asked whether there is a factor in the cell that confers CTD-dependence upon transcription. By placing a cleavage site for the tobacco etch virus protease prior to the CTD, we have created a highly specific method for removing the CTD from RNA Pol II in yeast whole cell extracts. Using derivatives of this strain, we have analyzed the role of the Srb8-11 complex, Mediator, and TFIIH, in CTD-dependent basal transcription by either mutation or immunodepletion of their function. We have found that Mediator is a direct intermediary of CTD-dependent basal transcription in extracts and that the requirement for Mediator and the CTD in basal transcription originates from their ability to compensate for a limiting amount of TFIIH activity in extracts.},

	Abstract = {The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe has proved an important model system for cross-species comparative studies of many fundamental processes in the eukaryotic cell, such as cell cycle control and DNA replication. The RNA polymerase II transcription machinery is, however, still relatively poorly understood in S. pombe, partially due to the absence of a reconstituted in vitro transcription system. We have now purified S. pombe RNA polymerase II and its general initiation factors TFIIB, TFIIF, TFIIE, and TFIIH to near homogeneity. These factors enable RNA polymerase II to initiate transcription from the S. pombe alcohol dehydrogenase promoter (adh1p) when combined with Saccharomyces cerevisiae TATA-binding protein. We use our reconstituted system to examine effects of Mediator on basal transcription in vitro. S. pombe Mediator exists in two distinct forms, a free form, which contains the spSrb8, spTrap240, spSrb10, and spSrb11 subunits, and a smaller form, which lacks these four subunits and associates with RNA polymerase II to form a holoenzyme. We find that spSrb8/spTrap240/spSrb10/spSrb11 containing Mediator repress basal transcription, whereas Mediator lacking these subunits has a stimulatory effect on transcription. Our findings thus demonstrate that the spSrb8/spTrap240/spSrb10/spSrb11 subcomplex governs the ability of Mediator to stimulate or repress basal transcription in vitro.},

	Abstract = {Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy is a powerful method for three-dimensional (3D) structure determination of macromolecular assemblies. Here we address the challenge of determining a 3D structure in the absence of reference models. The 3D structures are determined by alignment and weighted averaging of densities obtained by native cryo random conical tilt (RCT) reconstructions including consideration of missing data. Our weighted averaging scheme (wRCT) offers advantages for potentially heterogeneous 3D densities of low signal-to-noise ratios. Sets of aligned RCT structures can also be analyzed by multivariate statistical analysis (MSA) to provide insights into snapshots of the assemblies. The approach is used to compute 3D structures of the Escherichia coli 70S ribosome and the human U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP under vitrified unstained cryo conditions, and to visualize by 3D MSA the L7/L12 stalk of the 70S ribosome and states of tri-snRNP. The approach thus combines de novo 3D structure determination with an analysis of compositional and conformational heterogeneity.},

	Abstract = {Generating reliable initial models is a critical step in the reconstruction of asymmetric single-particles by 3D electron microscopy. This is particularly difficult to do if heterogeneity is present in the sample. The Random Conical Tilt (RCT) method, arguably the most robust presently to accomplish this task, requires significant user intervention to solve the "missing cone" problem. We present here a novel approach, termed the orthogonal tilt reconstruction method, that eliminates the missing cone altogether, making it possible for single-class volumes to be used directly as initial references in refinement without further processing. The method involves collecting data at +45 degrees and -45 degrees tilts and only requires that particles adopt a relatively large number of orientations on the grid. One tilted data set is used for alignment and classification and the other set--which provides views orthogonal to those in the first--is used for reconstruction, resulting in the absence of a missing cone. We have tested this method with synthetic data and compared its performance to that of the RCT method. We also propose a way of increasing the level of homogeneity in individual 2D classes (and volumes) in a heterogeneous data set and identifying the most homogeneous volumes.},

	Abstract = {Generating reliable initial models for novel asymmetric molecules, particularly heterogeneous ones, remains a major challenge in cryo-electron microscopy. Geometric reconstruction methods, relying on the ability to tilt the microscope stage to obtain two or more views of each molecule, are arguably the most robust for these types of samples as they generate independent reconstructions for each characteristic view obtained. Random Conical Tilt (RCT) is the classic geometric reconstruction method. Pairs of images are collected at high tilt (around 50$\,^{\circ}$) and 0$\,^{\circ}$. The latter are used to sort the data into characteristic views of the molecule and the former are used for their reconstruction. RCT's greatest strength is its ability to generate structures regardless of the number of orientations adopted by the sample on the support. Its major drawback stems from the limited tilt of the microscope stage; this results in an incomplete sampling of the structure in Fourier space and artifacts in its real space representation. Orthogonal Tilt Reconstruction (OTR), a modification of this data collection strategy, results in fully sampled structures. It relies on collecting data at -45$\,^{\circ}$ and +45$\,^{\circ}$ and treating the tilt pairs as equivalent to the ideal 0$\,^{\circ}$/90$\,^{\circ}$ that cannot be collected directly in the microscope. OTR requires a sample that adopts a large number of orientations on the support. Here, the RCT and OTR methods are reviewed and their performances with a biological test sample are compared. The steps required to apply OTR are also discussed.},

@article{Singer:2010aa,
	Abstract = {The single-particle reconstruction problem of electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) is to find the three-dimensional structure of a macromolecule given its two-dimensional noisy projection images at unknown random directions. Ab initio estimates of the 3D structure are often obtained by the "Angular Reconstitution" method, in which a coordinate system is established from three projections, and the orientation of the particle giving rise to each image is deduced from common lines among the images. However, a reliable detection of common lines is difficult due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the images. In this paper we describe a global self-correcting voting procedure in which all projection images participate to decide the identity of the consistent common lines. The algorithm determines which common line pairs were detected correctly and which are spurious. We show that the voting procedure succeeds at relatively low detection rates and that its performance improves as the number of projection images increases. We demonstrate the algorithm for both simulative and experimental images of the 50S ribosomal subunit.},

Mediator not only enabled activated transcription but also conferred 8-fold greater activity in basal transcription and 12-fold greater efficiency of phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II by the TFIIH-associated C-terminal repeat domain (CTD) kinase, indicative of mediator-CTD interaction. A holoenzyme form of RNA polymerase II was independently isolated that supported a response to activator proteins with purified basal factors. The holoenzyme proved to consist of mediator associated with core 12-subunit RNA polymerase II.},

	Abstract = {The GAL4 dimerization domain (GAL4-dd) is a powerful transcriptional activator when tethered to DNA in a cell bearing a mutant of the GAL11 protein, named GAL11P. GAL11P (like GAL11) is a component of the RNA-polymerase II holoenzyme. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies of GAL4-dd revealed an elongated dimer structure with C(2) symmetry containing three helices that mediate dimerization via coiled-coil contacts. The two loops between the three coiled coils form mobile bulges causing a variation of twist angles between the helix pairs. Chemical shift perturbation analysis mapped the GAL11P-binding site to the C-terminal helix alpha3 and the loop between alpha1 and alpha2. One GAL11P monomer binds to one GAL4-dd dimer rendering the dimer asymmetric and implying an extreme negative cooperativity mechanism. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of GAL4-dd showed that the NMR-derived GAL11P-binding face is crucial for the novel transcriptional activating function of the GAL4-dd on GAL11P interaction. The binding of GAL4 to GAL11P, although an artificial interaction, represents a unique structural motif for an activating region capable of binding to a single target to effect gene expression.},

We report that polymerase-free Mediator, isolated early on during a whole-cell extract fractionation protocol, is in fact the most abundant form of the Mediator complex. The existence of free Mediator would make possible independent recruitment of Mediator and RNA polymerase II to the pre-initiation complex. This is in agreement with reports from in vivo studies of time and spatial independence of Mediator and RNA polymerase II promoter interaction, with current models of pre-initiation complex structure in which promoter DNA upstream of the transcription start site is positioned between Mediator and polymerase, and with the proposed role of Mediator as the major component of the Scaffold complex involved in transcription reinitiation.},

The Head module adopts several conformations differing in the position of a movable jaw formed by the Med18-Med20 subcomplex. We also characterized, by structural, biochemical and genetic means, the interactions of the Head module with TATA-binding protein (TBP) and RNAPII subunits Rpb4 and Rpb7. TBP binds near the Med18-Med20 attachment point and stabilizes an open conformation of the Head module. Rpb4 and Rpb7 bind between the Head jaws, establishing contacts essential for yeast-cell viability. These results, and consideration of the structure of the Mediator-RNAPII holoenzyme, shed light on the stabilization of the pre-initiation complex by Mediator and suggest how Mediator might influence initiation by modulating polymerase conformation and interaction with promoter DNA.},

	Abstract = {Bacteria and archaea acquire resistance to viruses and plasmids by integrating short fragments of foreign DNA into clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs). These repetitive loci maintain a genetic record of all prior encounters with foreign transgressors. CRISPRs are transcribed and the long primary transcript is processed into a library of short CRISPR-derived RNAs (crRNAs) that contain a unique sequence complementary to a foreign nucleic-acid challenger. In Escherichia coli, crRNAs are incorporated into a multisubunit surveillance complex called Cascade (CRISPR-associated complex for antiviral defence), which is required for protection against bacteriophages. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to determine the subnanometre structures of Cascade before and after binding to a target sequence. These structures reveal a sea-horse-shaped architecture in which the crRNA is displayed along a helical arrangement of protein subunits that protect the crRNA from degradation while maintaining its availability for base pairing. Cascade engages invading nucleic acids through high-affinity base-pairing interactions near the 5' end of the crRNA. Base pairing extends along the crRNA, resulting in a series of short helical segments that trigger a concerted conformational change. This conformational rearrangement may serve as a signal that recruits a trans-acting nuclease (Cas3) for destruction of invading nucleic-acid sequences.},

Unbiased computational sorting of cryo-EM images yielded 50 distinct three-dimensional reconstructions, showing the tRNAs in classical, hybrid and various novel intermediate states that provide trajectories and kinetic information about tRNA movement through the ribosome. The structures indicate how tRNA movement is coupled with global and local conformational changes of the ribosome, in particular of the head and body of the small ribosomal subunit, and show that dynamic interactions between tRNAs and ribosomal residues confine the path of the tRNAs through the ribosome. The temperature dependence of ribosome dynamics reveals a surprisingly flat energy landscape of conformational variations at physiological temperature. The ribosome functions as a Brownian machine that couples spontaneous conformational changes driven by thermal energy to directed movement.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Structural information of macromolecular complexes provides key insights into the way they carry out their biological functions. The reconstruction process leading to the final 3D map requires an approximate initial model. Generation of an initial model is still an open and challenging problem in single-particle analysis.
RESULTS: We present a fast and efficient approach to obtain a reliable, low-resolution estimation of the 3D structure of a macromolecule, without any a priori knowledge, addressing the well-known issue of initial volume estimation in the field of single-particle analysis. The input of the algorithm is a set of class average images obtained from individual projections of a biological object at random and unknown orientations by transmission electron microscopy micrographs. The proposed method is based on an initial non-lineal dimensionality reduction approach, which allows to automatically selecting representative small sets of class average images capturing the most of the structural information of the particle under study. These reduced sets are then used to generate volumes from random orientation assignments. The best volume is determined from these guesses using a random sample consensus (RANSAC) approach. We have tested our proposed algorithm, which we will term 3D-RANSAC, with simulated and experimental data, obtaining satisfactory results under the low signal-to-noise conditions typical of cryo-electron microscopy.

Here, by exploiting simulated Zernike and conventional defocused cryoelectron microscope images with noise characteristics comparable to those of experimental data, we quantified the efficiencies of the steps in single particle analysis of ice-embedded RNA polymerase II (500 kDa), transferrin receptor complex (290 kDa), and T7 RNA polymerase lysozyme (100 kDa). Our results show Zernike phase plate imaging is more effective as to particle identification and also sorting of orientations, conformations, and compositions.

	Abstract = {GlnN, the type III glutamine synthetase (GSIII) from the medically important, anaerobic, opportunistic pathogen Bacteroides fragilis, has 82.8 kDa subunits that share only 9% sequence identity with the type I glutamine synthetases (GSI), the only family for which a structure is known. Active GlnN was found predominantly in a single peak that eluted from a calibrated gel-filtration chromatography column at a position equaivalent to 0.86(+/-0.08) MDa. Negative-stain electron microscopy enabled the identification of double-ringed particles and single hexameric rings ("pinwheels") resulting from partial staining. A 2D average of these pinwheels showed marked similarity to the corresponding structures found in preparations of GSI, except that the arms of the subunits were 40% longer. Reconstructions from particles embedded in vitreous ice showed that GlnN has a double-ringed, dodecameric structure with a 6-fold dihedral space group (D6) symmetry and dimensions of 17.0 nm parallel with the 6-fold axis and 18.3 nm parallel with the 2-fold axes. The structures, combined with a sequence alignment based on structural principles, showed how many aspects of the structure of GSI, and most notably the alpha/beta barrel fold active site were preserved. There was evidence for the presence of this structure in the reconstructed volume, thus, identifying the indentations between the pinwheel spokes as putative active sites and suggesting conservation of the overall molecular geometry found in GSI despite their low level of global homology. Furthermore, docking of GSI into the reconstruction left sufficient plausibly located unoccupied density to account for the additional residues in GSIII, thus validating the structure.},

	Abstract = {NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) is the first and largest complex in the electron transport chain of mitochondria. The bovine complex purified from cardiac muscle consists of at least 42 different subunits with a combined molecular mass of about 890 kDa. The three-dimensional structure of the complex was determined at 22 A from single particles embedded in vitrified ice using electron cryo-microscopy. The structure was calculated using a new program to align particles, to correct for the contrast transfer function of the microscope, and to carry out the three-dimensional reconstruction of the complex. The bovine complex has the overall L-shaped appearance found in earlier studies of the closely related complex I from Neurospora crassa, but it differs by having a thin stalk region linking the membrane-bound globular arm with the intrinsic membrane domain. Thus, the stalk which measures about 30 A in diameter is likely to contain part of the electron transfer pathway linking the NADH binding site in the globular arm with the ubiquinone binding site in the membrane domain. The globular domain of bovine complex I is significantly bigger than that of the N. crassa enzyme, suggesting that the apparent additional subunit complexity of the bovine enzyme is associated with the globular part.},

Many of the biochemical steps of this fundamental process are known, but a detailed understanding requires a well-defined structural model of the ribosome. Electron microscopy combined with image reconstruction of two-dimensional crystals or single ribosomes has been the most promising technique, but the resolution of the resulting models has been insufficient. Here we report a 25-A reconstruction of the ribosome from Escherichia coli, obtained by combining 4,300 projections of ice-embedded single particles. Our new reconstruction reveals a channel in the small ribosomal subunit and a bifurcating tunnel in the large subunit which may constitute pathways for the incoming message and the nascent polypeptide chain, respectively. Based on these new findings, a three-dimensional model of the basic framework of protein synthesis is presented.},

	Abstract = {A battery of sophisticated techniques is now available to extract three-dimensional structural information from electron micrographs of biological macromolecules occurring in the form of single particles. One of these techniques, the random-conical reconstruction method, which allows low-dose imaging, has been recently perfected and is being used routinely for the study of ribosomal architecture. The analysis of the 40S mammalian ribosomal subunit serves as an illustration of the various steps of image processing. The use of classification combined with 3-D reconstruction provides the means to investigate variations of the macromolecular structure (deformations, conformational changes, etc.) that are caused by the specimen preparation. An example is provided by the changes in the shape of the 70S monosome of E. coli as it changes its orientation on the carbon grid. The most challenging applications of the techniques discussed are in the area of cryo-microscopy of ice-embedded specimens. First studies of single macromolecules imaged in this way have indicated that the 3-D imaging methods and, specifically, the random-conical reconstruction method, will be applicable under these conditions.},

Data collection and reconstruction follow the protocol of the random-conical technique of Radermacher et al. [J. Microscopy 146 (1987) 113]. A reference-free alignment algorithm has been developed to overcome the propensity of reference-based algorithms to reinforce the reference motif in very noisy situations. In addition, an iterative 3D reconstruction method based on a chi-square minimization constraint has been developed and tested. This algorithm tends to reduce the effects of the missing angular range on the reconstruction, thereby facilitating the merging of random-conical data sets obtained from differently oriented particles.},

@article{Zhang:2011ae,
	Abstract = {To bring cryo electron microscopy (cryoEM) of large biological complexes to atomic resolution, several factors--in both cryoEM image acquisition and 3D reconstruction--that may be neglected at low resolution become significantly limiting. Here we present thorough analyses of four limiting factors: (a) electron-beam tilt, (b) inaccurate determination of defocus values, (c) focus gradient through particles, and (d) particularly for large particles, dynamic (multiple) scattering of electrons. We also propose strategies to cope with these factors: (a) the divergence and direction tilt components of electron-beam tilt could be reduced by maintaining parallel illumination and by using a coma-free alignment procedure, respectively. Moreover, the effect of all beam tilt components, including spiral tilt, could be eliminated by use of a spherical aberration corrector. (b) More accurate measurement of defocus value could be obtained by imaging areas adjacent to the target area at high electron dose and by measuring the image shift induced by tilting the electron beam. (c) Each known Fourier coefficient in the Fourier transform of a cryoEM image is the sum of two Fourier coefficients of the 3D structure, one on each of two curved 'characteristic surfaces' in 3D Fourier space. We describe a simple model-based iterative method that could recover these two Fourier coefficients on the two characteristic surfaces. (d) The effect of dynamic scattering could be corrected by deconvolution of a transfer function. These analyses and our proposed strategies offer useful guidance for future experimental designs targeting atomic resolution cryoEM reconstruction.},

The use of current-axis alignment is not always sufficient, for example, to avoid the introduction of large phase errors, at higher resolution, due to axial coma. In addition, one must also ensure that off-axis coma does not corrupt the data quality at the higher resolution. We particularly emphasize that the standard CTF correction does not account for the phase error associated with coma. We explain the cause of both axial coma and the typically most troublesome component of off-axis coma in terms of the well-known shift of the electron diffraction pattern relative to the optical axis that occurs when the illumination is not parallel to the axis. We review the experimental conditions under which coma causes unacceptably large phase errors, and we discuss steps that can be taken when setting up the conditions of illumination, so as to ensure that neither axial nor off-axis coma is a problem.},

	Abstract = {In an electron microscope, the electron beam used to determine the structures of biological tissues, cells, and molecules destroys the specimen as the image is acquired. This destruction occurs before a statistically well-defined image can be obtained and is consequently the fundamental limit to resolution in biological electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM). Damage from the destructive interaction of electrons with frozen-hydrated specimens occurs in three stages: primary damage, as electrons ionize the sample, break bonds, and produce secondary electrons and free radicals; secondary damage, as the secondary electrons and free radicals migrate through the specimen and cause further chemical reactions; and tertiary damage, as hydrogen gas is evolved within the sample, causing gross morphological changes to the specimen. The deleterious effects of radiation are minimized in cryo-EM by limiting the exposure of the specimen to incident electrons and cooling the sample to reduce secondary damage. This review emphasizes practical considerations for minimizing radiation damage, including measurement of electron exposure, estimation of absorbed doses of energy, selection of microscope voltage and specimen temperature, and selection of electron exposure to optimize images.},

	Abstract = {Over the years Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) has evolved into a powerful technique for the structural analysis of cells and tissues at various levels of resolution. However, optimal sample preservation is required to achieve results consistent with reality. During the last few decades, conventional preparation methods have provided most of the knowledge about the ultrastructure of organelles, cells and tissues. Nevertheless, some artefacts can be introduced at all stagesofstandard electron microscopy preparation technique. Instead, rapid freezing techniques preserve biological specimens as close as possible to the native state. Our review focuses on different cryo-preparation approaches, starting from vitrification methods dependent on sample size. Afterwards, we discuss Cryo-Electron Microscopy Of VItreous Sections (CEMOVIS) and the main difficulties associated with this technique. Cryo-Focused Ion Beam (cryo-FIB) is described as a potential alternative for CEMOVIS. Another post-processing route for vitrified samples is freeze substitution and embedding in resin for structural analysis or immunolocalization analysis. Cryo-sectioning according to Tokuyasu is a technique dedicated to high efficiency immunogold labelling. Finally, we introduce hybrid techniques, which combine advantages of primary techniques originally dedicated to different approaches. Hybrid approaches permit to perform the study of difficult-to-fix samples and antigens or help optimize the sample preparation protocol for the integrated Laser and Electron Microscopy (iLEM) technique.},

For cellular studies, the conventional imaging modality of transmission electron microscopy places stringent constraints on sample thickness because of its dependence on phase coherence for contrast generation. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of using scanning transmission electron microscopy for cryo-tomography of unstained vitrified specimens (CSTET). We compare CSTET and CET for the imaging of whole bacteria and human tissue culture cells, finding favorable contrast and detail in the CSTET reconstructions. Particularly at high sample tilts, the CSTET signals contain more informative data than energy-filtered CET phase contrast images, resulting in improved depth resolution. Careful control over dose delivery permits relatively high cumulative exposures before the onset of observable beam damage. The increase in acceptable specimen thickness broadens the applicability of electron cryo-tomography.},

Although the three-dimensional architecture of FAS has been mostly defined, it is unclear how reaction intermediates can transfer between distant catalytic domains. Using single-particle EM, we have identified a near continuum of conformations consistent with a remarkable flexibility of FAS. The distribution of conformations was influenced by the presence of substrates and altered by different catalytic mutations, suggesting a direct correlation between conformation and specific enzymatic activities. We interpreted three-dimensional reconstructions by docking high-resolution structures of individual domains, and they show that the substrate-loading and condensation domains dramatically swing and swivel to access substrates within either reaction chamber. Concomitant rearrangement of the beta-carbon-processing domains synchronizes acyl chain reduction in one chamber with acyl chain elongation in the other.},

	Abstract = {In electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM), the electron beam that is used for imaging also causes the sample to move. This motion blurs the images and limits the resolution attainable by single-particle analysis. In a previous Research article (Bai et al., 2013) we showed that correcting for this motion by processing movies from fast direct-electron detectors allowed structure determination to near-atomic resolution from 35,000 ribosome particles. In this Research advance article, we show that an improved movie processing algorithm is applicable to a much wider range of specimens. The new algorithm estimates straight movement tracks by considering multiple particles that are close to each other in the field of view, and models the fall-off of high-resolution information content by radiation damage in a dose-dependent manner. Application of the new algorithm to four data sets illustrates its potential for significantly improving cryo-EM structures, even for particles that are smaller than 200 kDa.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03665.001.},

	Abstract = {Although cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) of biological macromolecules has made important advances in the past few years, the level of current technical performance is still well below what the physics of electron scattering would allow. It should be possible, for example, to use cryo-EM to solve protein structures at atomic resolution for particle sizes well below 80 kDa, but currently this has been achieved only for particles at least 10 times larger than that. In this review, we first examine some of the reasons for this large gap in performance. We then give an overview of work that is currently in progress to 1), improve the signal/noise ratio for area detectors; 2), improve the signal transfer between the scattered electrons and the corresponding images; and 3), reduce the extent to which beam-induced movement causes a steep fall-off of signal at high resolution. In each case, there is substantial reason to think that cryo-EM can indeed be made to approach the estimated physical limits.},

	Abstract = {Helical assemblies such as filamentous viruses, flagella, and F-actin represent an important category of structures in biology. As the first discovered virus, tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) was at the center of virus research. Previously, the structure of TMV was solved at atomic detail by X-ray fiber diffraction but only for its dormant or high-calcium-concentration state, not its low-calcium-concentration state, which is relevant to viral assembly and disassembly inside host cells. Here we report a helical reconstruction of TMV in its calcium-free, metastable assembling state at 3.3 {\AA} resolution by cryo electron microscopy, revealing both protein side chains and RNA bases. An atomic model was built de novo showing marked differences from the high-calcium, dormant-state structure. Although it could be argued that there might be inaccuracies in the latter structure derived from X-ray fiber diffraction, these differences can be interpreted as conformational changes effected by calcium-driven switches, a common regulatory mechanism in plant viruses. Our comparisons of the structures of the low- and high-calcium states indicate that hydrogen bonds formed by Asp116 and Arg92 in the place of the calcium ion of the dormant (high-calcium) state might trigger allosteric changes in the RNA base-binding pockets of the coat protein. In turn, the coat protein-RNA interactions in our structure favor an adenine-X-guanine (A*G) motif over the G*A motif of the dormant state, thus offering an explanation underlying viral assembly initiation by an AAG motif.},

	Abstract = {The nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor is the neurotransmitter-gated ion channel responsible for the rapid propagation of electrical signals between cells at the nerve/muscle synapse. We report here the 4.6 A structure of this channel in the closed conformation, determined by electron microscopy of tubular crystals of Torpedo postsynaptic membranes embedded in amorphous ice. The analysis was conducted on images recorded at 4 K with a 300 kV field emission source, by combining data from four helical families of tubes (-16,6; -18,6; -15,7; -17,5), and applying three-dimensional corrections for lattice distortions. The study extends earlier work on the same specimen at 9 A resolution. Several features having functional implications now appear with better definition. The gate of the channel forms a narrow bridge, consisting of no more than one or two rings of side-chains, across the middle portion of the membrane-spanning pore. Tunnels, framed by twisted beta-sheet strands, are resolved in the extracellular wall of the channel connecting the water-filled vestibule to the putative ACh-binding pockets. A set of narrow openings through which ions can flow are resolved between alpha-helical segments forming part of the cytoplasmic wall of the channel. It is suggested that the extracellular tunnels are access routes to the binding pockets for ACh, and that the cytoplasmic openings serve as filters to exclude anions and other impermeant species from the vicinity of the pore. Both transverse pathways are likely to be important in achieving a rapid postsynaptic response.},

	Abstract = {The fact that radiation damage would limit the usefulness of electron microscopy with biological specimens was a concern in the earliest days of the field. Good estimates of what that limitation must be can be made by using Rose's empirical relationship between the inherent image contrast, the exposure used to record an image, and the smallest feature size that is detectable. Such estimates show that it is necessary to average many images in order to obtain statistically well-defined data at high resolution. Structures are now routinely obtained by averaging large numbers of shot-noise limited images, and some of these extend to atomic resolution. The signal level in current images is nevertheless far below what physics would allow it to be. A possible explanation is that beam-induced movement limits the quality of images recorded by electron microscopy. For specimens embedded in vitreous ice, beam-induced movement can even be severe enough to limit the resolution achieved during tomographic reconstruction. The fact that very high-quality images can nevertheless be obtained, although only unpredictably, suggests that it may be possible to devise new techniques of specimen preparation and/or data collection that at least partially overcome beam-induced movement. If so, the need for image averaging would be correspondingly reduced.},

Direct electron detection using CMOS-based sensors for digitally recording images has the potential to alleviate this shortcoming. Here, we report a practical performance evaluation of a Direct Detection Device (DDD{\textregistered}) for biological cryo-EM at two different microscope voltages: 200 and 300 kV. Our DDD images of amorphous and graphitized carbon show strong per-pixel contrast with image resolution near the theoretical sampling limit of the data. Single-particle reconstructions of two frozen-hydrated bacteriophages, P22 and ε15, establish that the DDD is capable of recording usable signal for 3D reconstructions at about 4/5 of the Nyquist frequency, which is a vast improvement over the performance of conventional imaging media. We anticipate the unparalleled performance of this digital recording device will dramatically benefit cryo-EM for routine tomographic and single-particle structural determination of biological specimens.},

The procedure is facilitated by the use of (a) variable angular step-sizes during iterative origin and orientation searches, (b) high numbers of particle images, and (c) highly defocused images. The method is inhibited by mixed-handedness orientation assignments and by particles with inconspicuous features. For symmetric particles, symmetric RMMs can overcome these deficiencies.},

	Abstract = {Accurately determining a cryoEM particle's alignment parameters is crucial to high resolution single particle 3-D reconstruction. We developed Multi-Path Simulated Annealing, a Monte-Carlo type of optimization algorithm, for globally aligning the center and orientation of a particle simultaneously. A consistency criterion was developed to ensure the alignment parameters are correct and to remove some bad particles from a large pool of images of icosahedral particles. Without using any a priori model, this procedure is able to reconstruct a structure from a random initial model. Combining the procedure above with a new empirical double threshold particle selection method, we are able to pick tens of best quality particles to reconstruct a subnanometer resolution map from scratch. Using the best 62 particles of rice dwarf virus, the reconstruction reached 9.6A resolution at which four helices of the P3A subunit of RDV are resolved. Furthermore, with the 284 best particles, the reconstruction is improved to 7.9A resolution, and 21 of 22 helices and six of seven beta sheets are resolved.},

	Abstract = {Single particle cryo-electron microscopy is currently poised to produce high-resolution structures of many biological assemblies, but several pitfalls can trap the unwary. This critique highlights one problem that is particularly relevant when smaller structures are being studied. It is known as "Einstein from noise," in which the experimenter honestly believes they have recorded images of their particles, whereas in reality, most if not all of their data consist of pure noise. Selection of particles using cross-correlation methods can then lead to 3D maps that resemble the model used in the initial selection and provide the illusion of progress. Suggestions are given about how to circumvent the problem.},

	Abstract = {Electron tomography (ET) is uniquely suited to obtain three-dimensional reconstructions of pleomorphic structures, such as cells, organelles or supramolecular assemblies. Although the principles of ET have been known for decades, its use has gathered momentum only in recent years, thanks to technological advances and its combination with improved specimen preparation techniques. The rapid freezing/freeze-substitution preparation is applicable to whole cells and tissues, and it is the method of choice for ET investigations of cellular ultrastructure. The frozen-hydrated preparation provides the best possible structural preservation and allows the imaging of molecules, complexes, and supramolecular assemblies in their native state and their natural environment. Devoid of staining and chemical fixation artifacts, cryo-ET provides a faithful representation of both the surface and internal structure of molecules. In combination with advanced computational methods, such as molecular identification based on pattern recognition techniques, cryo-ET is currently the most promising approach to comprehensively map macromolecular architecture inside cellular tomograms.},

We evaluated here the potential of one such detector (Gatan K2 Summit) to enable the achievement of near-atomic resolution reconstructions of biological specimens when coupled to a widely used, mid-range transmission electron microscope (FEI TF20 Twin). Compensating for beam-induced motion and stage drift provided a 4.4{\AA} resolution map of Sulfolobus turreted icosahedral virus (STIV), which we used as a test particle in this study. Several motion correction and dose fractionation procedures were explored and we describe their influence on the resolution of the final reconstruction.

This camera has a significantly improved signal to noise ratio and modulation transfer function (MTF) at 200keV compared to a standard CCD camera installed on the same microscope. Control of the DDD has been integrated into Leginon, an automated data collection system. Using GroEL as a test specimen, we obtained images of ∼30K particles with the CCD and the DDD from the same specimen sample using essentially identical imaging conditions. Comparison of the maps reconstructed from the CCD images and the DDD images demonstrates the improved performance of the DDD. We also obtained a 3D reconstruction from ∼70K GroEL particles acquired using the DDD; the quality of the density map demonstrates the potential of this new recording device for cryoEM data acquisition.},

	Abstract = {The resolution value claimed for an electron microscopical three-dimensional reconstruction indicates the overall quality of the experiment. The Fourier shell correlation (FSC) criterion has now become the standard quality measure. However, what has continued to be controversial is the issue of the FSC threshold level at which one defines the reproducible resolution. Here, we discuss the theoretical behaviour of the FSC in conjunction with the various factors which influence it: the number of "voxels" in a given Fourier shell, the symmetry of the structure, and the size of the structure within the reconstruction volume. Both the theoretical considerations and our model experiments show that fixed-valued FSC threshold (like "0.5") may never be used in a reproducible criterion. Fixed threshold values are-as we show here-simply the result of incorrect assumptions in the basic statistics. Two families of FSC threshold curves are discussed: the sigma-factor curves and the new family of bit-based information threshold curves. Whereas sigma-factor curves indicate the resolution level at which one has collected information significantly above the noise level, the information curves indicate the resolution level at which enough information has been collected for interpretation.},

This formulation results in a fast algorithm that can easily accommodate a large number of displacement labels, has provable robustness to noise and a close to global solution. We experimentally demonstrate the validity of our formulation on synthetic and real medical data.},

	Abstract = {This paper introduces an algorithm for direct search of control policies in continuous-state discrete-action Markov decision processes. The algorithm looks for the best closed-loop policy that can be represented using a given number of basis functions (BFs), where a discrete action is assigned to each BF. The type of the BFs and their number are specified in advance and determine the complexity of the representation. Considerable flexibility is achieved by optimizing the locations and shapes of the BFs, together with the action assignments. The optimization is carried out with the cross-entropy method and evaluates the policies by their empirical return from a representative set of initial states. The return for each representative state is estimated using Monte Carlo simulations. The resulting algorithm for cross-entropy policy search with adaptive BFs is extensively evaluated in problems with two to six state variables, for which it reliably obtains good policies with only a small number of BFs. In these experiments, cross-entropy policy search requires vastly fewer BFs than value-function techniques with equidistant BFs, and outperforms policy search with a competing optimization algorithm called DIRECT.},

The solver, which is based on the theory of rare event simulation, is general and stochastic. Unlike some popular optimization methods such as belief propagation and graph cuts, CE makes no assumption on the form of objective functions and thus can be applied to any type of MRF models. Furthermore, it achieves higher performance of finding more global optima because of its stochastic property. In addition, it is more efficient than other stochastic methods like simulated annealing. We tested the new solver in 4 series of segmentation experiments on synthetic and clinical, vascular and cerebral images. The experiments show that CE can give more accurate segmentation results.},

	Abstract = {Cross-entropy (CE), an information-theoretic measure, quantifies the difference between two probability density functions. This measure is applied to volume image registration. When a good prior estimation of the joint distribution of the voxel values of two images in registration is available, the CE can be minimized to find an optimal registration. If such a prior estimation is not available, one seeks the registration which gives a joint distribution different from unlikely ones as much as possible, i.e., the CE is maximized to find an optimal registration. When the unlikely distribution is a uniform one, CE maximization reduces to joint entropy minimization; when the unlikely distribution is proportional to one of the marginal distributions, it reduces to conditional entropy minimization; when the unlikely distribution is the product of two marginal distributions, it degenerates to mutual-information maximization. These different CEs are added together and are used as criteria for image registration. The accuracy and robustness of this new approach are tested and compared using a likely joint distribution and various unlikely joint distributions and their combinations.},

@article{Beatty:2005aa,
	Abstract = {Reconstruction of magnetic resonance images from data not falling on a Cartesian grid is a Fourier inversion problem typically solved using convolution interpolation, also known as gridding. Gridding is simple and robust and has parameters, the grid oversampling ratio and the kernel width, that can be used to trade accuracy for computational memory and time reductions. We have found that significant reductions in computation memory and time can be obtained while maintaining high accuracy by using a minimal oversampling ratio, from 1.125 to 1.375, instead of the typically employed grid oversampling ratio of two. When using a minimal oversampling ratio, appropriate design of the convolution kernel is important for maintaining high accuracy. We derive a simple equation for choosing the optimal Kaiser-Bessel convolution kernel for a given oversampling ratio and kernel width. As well, we evaluate the effect of presampling the kernel, a common technique used to reduce the computation time, and find that using linear interpolation between samples adds negligible error with far less samples than is necessary with nearest-neighbor interpolation. We also develop a new method for choosing the optimal presampled kernel. Using a minimal oversampling ratio and presampled kernel, we are able to perform a three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction in one-eighth the time and requiring one-third the computer memory versus using an oversampling ratio of two and a Kaiser-Bessel convolution kernel, while maintaining the same level of accuracy.},

	Abstract = {The three-dimensional structure of wild-type yeast RNA polymerase II has been determined at a nominal resolution of 24 A. A difference map between this structure and that of the polymerase lacking subunits Rpb4 and Rpb7 showed these two subunits forming part of the floor of the DNA-binding (active center) cleft, and revealed a slight inward movement of the protein domain surrounding the cleft. Surface plasmon resonance measurements showed that Rpb4 and Rpb7 stabilize a minimal pre-initiation complex containing promoter DNA, TATA box-binding protein (TBP), transcription factor TFIIB and the polymerase. These findings suggest that Rpb4 and Rpb7 play a role in coupling the entry of DNA into the active center cleft to closure of the cleft. Such a role can explain why these subunits are necessary for promoter-specific transcription in vitro and for a normal stress response in vivo.},

	Abstract = {A method is proposed for selecting and aligning images of single biological particles to obtain high-resolution structural information by cryoelectron microscopy. The particles will be labeled with multiple heavy atom clusters to permit the precise determination of particle locations and relative orientations even when imaged close to focus with a low electron dose, conditions optimal for recording high-resolution detail. Heavy atom clusters should also allow selection of images free from many kinds of defects, including specimen movement and particle inhomogeneity. Heavy atom clusters may be introduced in a general way by the construction of "adaptor" molecules based on single-chain Fv antibody fragments, consisting of a constant framework region engineered for optimal cluster binding and a variable antigen binding region selected for a specific target. The success of the method depends on the mobility of the heavy atom cluster on the particle, on the precision to which clusters can be located in an image, and on the sufficiency of cluster projections alone to orient and select particles for averaging. The necessary computational algorithms were developed and implemented in simulations that address the feasibility of the method.},

They did not provide a mathematical justification for their concept. Our paper provides this, by showing (in the idealized case of noiseless data being available for all projection directions) that the reconstructions obtained based on DGCBP from data produced with distance-dependent blurring are essentially the same as what is obtained by a classical method of reconstruction of a 3D object from its line integrals. The approach is general enough to be applicable for correcting for any distance-dependent blurring during projection data collection. We present a new implementation of the DGCBP concept, one that closely follows the mathematics of its justifications, and illustrate it using mathematically described phantoms and their reconstructions from finitely many distance-dependently blurred projections.},

This algorithm, which is applied after dimension reduction by correspondence analysis or by principal components analysis, dynamically learns the parameters of the multivariate Gaussian distributions that characterize each class. These distributions describe tilted ellipsoidal clusters that adaptively adjust shape to capture differences in the variances of factors and the correlations of factors within classes. A novel Bayesian procedure to objectively select factors for inclusion in the classification models is a component of this procedure.

Many of the steps in this process rely strongly on the aid of pre-existing structural knowledge, and are greatly complicated when this information is unavailable. Here, we present two software tools meant to facilitate particle picking, an early stage in the single-particle processing of unknown macromolecules. The first tool, DoG Picker, is an efficient and reasonably general, particle picker based on the Difference of Gaussians (DoG) image transform. It can function alone, as a reference-free particle picker with the unique ability to sort particles based on size, or it can also be used as a way to bootstrap the creation of templates or training datasets for other particle pickers. The second tool is TiltPicker, an interactive graphical interface application designed to streamline the selection of particle pairs from tilted-pair datasets. In many respects, TiltPicker is a re-implementation of the SPIDER WEB tilted-particle picker, but built on modern computer frameworks making it easier to deploy and maintain. The TiltPicker program also includes several useful new features beyond those of its predecessor.},

The enzyme is a hetero-oligomer ( approximately 1MDa) composed of three distinct subunits (alpha, beta and gamma) with molecular masses of 109, 104 and 41kDa, respectively. While the alpha- and beta-subunits show sequence similarities to other phosphofructokinase subunits, the gamma-subunit does not show high homology to any known protein in the databases. We have determined the first quaternary structure of P. pastoris phosphofructokinase by 3D electron microscopy. Random conical techniques and tomography have been instrumental to ascertain the quality of the sample preparations for structural studies and to obtain a reliable 3D structure. The final reconstruction of P. pastoris Pfk resembles its yeast counterparts with four additional densities, assigned to four gamma-subunits, bridging the N-terminal domains of the four pairs of alpha- and beta-subunits. Our data has evidenced novel interactions between the gamma- and the alpha-subunits comparable in intensity to the interactions, shown by cross-linking and limited proteolytic degradation experiments, between the gamma- and beta-subunits. The structural data provides clear insights into the allosteric fine-tuned regulation of the enzyme by ATP and AMP observed in this yeast species.},

A lower dimensional subspace of significant features is selected, into which the data are projected, and if desired, subsequently classified. In addition, our new algorithm estimates the missing data for each individual volume within the lower dimensional subspace.

	Abstract = {When heterogeneous samples of macromolecular assemblies are being examined by 3D electron microscopy (3DEM), often multiple reconstructions are obtained. For example, subtomograms of individual particles can be acquired from tomography, or volumes of multiple 2D classes can be obtained by random conical tilt reconstruction. Of these, similar volumes can be averaged to achieve higher resolution. Volume alignment is an essential step before 3D classification and averaging. Here we present a projection-based volume alignment (PBVA) algorithm. We select a set of projections to represent the reference volume and align them to a second volume. Projection alignment is achieved by maximizing the cross-correlation function with respect to rotation and translation parameters. If data are missing, the cross-correlation functions are normalized accordingly. Accurate alignments are obtained by averaging and quadratic interpolation of the cross-correlation maximum. Comparisons of the computation time between PBVA and traditional 3D cross-correlation methods demonstrate that PBVA outperforms the traditional methods. Performance tests were carried out with different signal-to-noise ratios using modeled noise and with different percentages of missing data using a cryo-EM dataset. All tests show that the algorithm is robust and highly accurate. PBVA was applied to align the reconstructions of a subcomplex of the NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Complex I) from the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica, followed by classification and averaging.},

Among the methods investigated, the component averaging techniques have proven to be most efficient and have generally shown fast convergence rates. The use of smooth basis functions provides the reconstruction algorithms with an implicit regularization mechanism, very appropriate for noisy conditions. Furthermore, we have applied high-performance computing (HPC) techniques to address the computational requirements demanded by the reconstruction of large volumes. One of the standard techniques in parallel computing, domain decomposition, has yielded an effective computational algorithm which hides the latencies due to interprocessor communication. We present comparisons with weighted back-projection (WBP), one of the standard reconstruction methods in the areas of computational demand and reconstruction quality under noisy conditions. These techniques yield better results, according to objective measures of quality, than the weighted backprojection techniques after a very few iterations. As a consequence, the combination of efficient iterative algorithms and HPC techniques has proven to be well suited to the reconstruction of large biological specimens in electron tomography, yielding solutions in reasonable computation times.},

	Abstract = {Tomography emerges as a powerful methodology for determining the complex architectures of biological specimens that are better regarded from the structural point of view as singular entities. However, once the structure of a sufficiently large number of singular specimens is solved, quite possibly structural patterns start to emerge. This latter situation is addressed here, where the clustering of a set of 3D reconstructions using a novel quantitative approach is presented. In general terms, we propose a new variant of a self-organizing neural network for the unsupervised classification of 3D reconstructions. The novelty of the algorithm lies in its rigorous mathematical formulation that, starting from a large set of noisy input data, finds a set of "representative" items, organized onto an ordered output map, such that the probability density of this set of representative items resembles at its possible best the probability density of the input data. In this study, we evaluate the feasibility of application of the proposed neural approach to the problem of identifying similar 3D motifs within tomograms of insect flight muscle. Our experimental results prove that this technique is suitable for this type of problem, providing the electron microscopy community with a new tool for exploring large sets of tomogram data to find complex patterns.},

	Abstract = {In this work, a powerful parametric spectral estimation technique, 2D-auto regressive moving average modeling (ARMA), has been applied to contrast transfer function (CTF) detection in electron microscopy. Parametric techniques such as auto regressive (AR) and ARMA models allow a more exact determination of the CTF than traditional methods based only on the Fourier transform of the complete image or parts of it and performing some average (periodogram averaging). Previous works revealed that AR models can be used to improve CTF estimation and the detection of its zeros. ARMA models reduce the model order and the computing time, and more interestingly, achieve increased accuracy. ARMA models are generated from electron microscopy (EM) images, and then a stepwise search algorithm is used to fit all the parameters of a theoretical CTF model in the ARMA model previously calculated. Furthermore, this adjustment is truly two-dimensional, allowing astigmatic images to be properly treated. Finally, an individual CTF can be assigned to every point of the micrograph, by means of an interpolation at the functional level, provided that a CTF has been estimated in each one of a set of local areas. The user need only know a few a priori parameters of the experimental conditions of his micrographs, for turning this technique into an automatic and very powerful tool for CTF determination, prior to CTF correction in 3D-EM. The programs developed for the above tasks have been integrated into the X-Windows-based Microscopy Image Processing Package (Xmipp) software package, and are fully accessible at www.biocomp.cnb.uam.es.},

	Abstract = {FEMME (Feature Extraction in a Multi-resolution Macromolecular Environment: http://www.biocomp.cnb.uam.es/FEMME/) database version 1.0 is a new bioinformatics data resource that collects topologic and geometric information obtained from macromolecular structures solved by three-dimensional electron microscopy (3D-EM). Although the FEMME database is focused on medium resolution data, the methodology employed (based on the so-called alpha-shape theory) is applicable to atomic resolution data as well. The alpha-shape representation allows the automatic extraction of structural features from 3D-EM volumes and their subsequent characterisation. FEMME is being populated with 3D-EM data stored in the electron microscopy database EMD-DB (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd/). However, and since the number of entries in EMD-DB is still relatively small, FEMME is also being populated in this initial phase with structural data from PDB and PQS databases (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/ and pqs.ebi.ac.uk/, respectively) whose resolution has been lowered accordingly. Each FEMME entry contains macromolecular geometry and topology information with a detailed description of its structural features. Moreover, FEMME data have facilitated the study and development of a method to retrieve macromolecular structures by their structural content based on the combined use of spin images and neural networks with encouraging results. Therefore, the FEMME database constitutes a powerful tool that provides a uniform and automatic way of analysing volumes coming from 3D-EM that will hopefully help the scientific community to perform wide structural comparisons.},

	Abstract = {Three-dimensional electron microscopy (3D-EM) is a powerful tool for visualizing complex biological systems. As with any other imaging device, the electron microscope introduces a transfer function (called in this field the contrast transfer function, CTF) into the image acquisition process that modulates the various frequencies of the signal. Thus, the 3D reconstructions performed with these CTF-affected projections are also affected by an implicit 3D transfer function. For high-resolution electron microscopy, the effect of the CTF is quite dramatic and limits severely the achievable resolution. In this work we make use of the iterative data refinement (IDR) technique to ameliorate the effect of the CTF. It is demonstrated that the approach can be successfully applied to noisy data.},

The 3D reconstruction of a macromolecule using single-particle techniques involves thousands of 2D projections. One of the key parameters required to perform such a 3D reconstruction is the orientation of each projection image as well as its in-plane orientation. This information is unknown experimentally and must be determined using image-processing techniques. We propose the use of wavelets to match the experimental projections with those obtained from a reference 3D model. The wavelet decomposition of the projection images provides a framework for a multiscale matching algorithm in which speed and robustness to noise are gained. Furthermore, this multiresolution approach is combined with a novel orientation selection strategy. Results obtained from computer simulations as well as experimental data encourage the use of this approach.},

This has the advantage of making it convenient to introduce additional constraints (such as the support of the function to be reconstructed, which may be known from alternative measurements) and has the potential of more accurately modeling the TEM image formation process. Phantom experiments indicate the superiority of the new approach even without the introduction of constraints in addition to the projection data.},

	Abstract = {Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum MCM (mtMCM) is a helicase required for DNA replication. Previous electron microscopy studies have shown mtMCM in several oligomeric forms. However, biochemical studies suggest that mtMCM is a dodecamer, likely a double hexamer (dHex). The crystal structure of the N-terminal fragment of mtMCM reveals a stable dHex architecture. To further confirm that the dHex is not an artifact of crystal packing of two hexamers, we investigated the relevance of the dHex by disrupting the hexamer-hexamer interactions seen in the crystal structure via site-directed mutagenesis and examining various biochemical activities of the mutants in vitro. Using a combination of biochemical and structural assays, we demonstrated that changing arginine to alanine at amino acid position 161 or the insertion of a six-aminoacid peptide at the hexamer-hexamer interface disrupted dHex formation and produced stable single hexamers (sHex). Furthermore, we showed that the sHex mutants retained wild-type level of ATPase and DNA binding activities but had decreased helicase activity when compared with the wild type dHex protein. These biochemical properties of mtMCM are reminiscent of those of SV40 large T antigen, suggesting that the dHex form of mtMCM may be the active helicase for DNA unwinding during the bidirectional DNA replication.},

Here we present the first three-dimensional electron microscopy reconstruction of the full-length mtMCM dHex in which two hexamers contact each other via the structurally well defined N-terminal domains. The dHex has obvious side openings that resemble the side channels of LTag (large T antigen). 6-fold and 7-fold rings were observed in the same mtMCM preparation, but we determined that assembly as a double ring favors 6-fold structures. Additionally, open rings were also detected, which suggests a direct mtMCM loading mechanism onto DNA.},

	Abstract = {Large T antigen (LTag) from simian virus 40 (SV40) is an ATP-driven DNA helicase that specifically recognizes the core of the viral origin of replication (ori), where it oligomerizes as a double hexamer. During this process, binding of the first hexamer stimulates the assembly of a second one. Using electron microscopy, we show that the N-terminal part of LTag that includes the origin-binding domain does not present a stable quaternary structure in single hexamers. This disordered region, however, is well arranged within the LTag double hexamer after specific ori recognition, where it mediates the interactions between hexamers and constructs a separated structural module at their junction. We conclude that full assembly of LTag hexamers occurs only within the dodecamer, and requires the specific hexamer-hexamer interactions established upon binding to the origin of replication. This mechanism provides the structural basis for the cooperative assembly of LTag double hexamer on the cognate viral ori.},

A structural alignment of domains belonging to the superfamily, followed by a principal components analysis, is performed, and the first three principal components of the decomposition are explored. Using rigid body transformations for the secondary structure elements (SSEs) plus the cyclic coordinate descent algorithm to close the loops, stereochemically correct models are built for the structure to fit. All of the models are fitted into the 3D-EM map, and the best one is selected based on crosscorrelation measures. This work applies the method to both simulated and experimental data and shows that the flexible fitting was able to produce better results than rigid body fitting.},

S-flexfit uses the evolutionary information contained in protein domain databases like CATH, by means of the structural alignment of the elements of a protein superfamily. The added development is based on a recent extension of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm specifically designed for situations with missing data: Incremental Singular Value Decomposition (ISVD). ISVD can manage gaps and allows considering more aminoacids in the structural alignment of a superfamily, extending the range of application and producing better models for the fitting step of our methodology. Our previous SVD-based flexible fitting approach can only take into account positions with no gaps in the alignment, being appropriate when the superfamily members are relatively similar and there are few gaps. However, with new data coming from structural proteomics works, the later situation is becoming less likely, making ISVD the technique of choice for further works. We present the results of using ISVD in the process of flexible fitting with both simulated and experimental 3D-EM maps (GroEL and Poliovirus 135S cell entry intermediate).},

We present here the 3D electron microscopy structure of the DnaB protein, along with a detailed analysis of both its oligomeric state and its domain organization. DnaB is organized as an asymmetric tetramer that is comprised of two stacked components, one arranged as a closed collar and the other as an open sigma shape.

Specifically, in the field of sequence data, many efforts have been made not only to store information in databases, but also to annotate it and then share these annotations through a standard XML (eXtensible Markup Language) protocol and appropriate integration clients. This is the context in which the Distributed Annotation System (DAS) has emerged in genomics. Additionally, initiatives in the field of structural data, such as the extension of DAS to atomic resolution data, which generated the SPICE client, have also occurred. This paper presents 3D-EM DAS, a further extension of the DAS protocol that allows sharing annotations about hybrid models. This annotation system has been built on the basis of the EMDB, which stores Three-dimensional Electron Microscopy (3D-EM) volumes, PDB, which houses atomic coordinates, and UniProt (for protein sequences) databases. In this way, annotations for sequences, atomic coordinates, and 3D-EM volumes are collected and displayed through a single graphical visualization client. Thus, users have an integrated view of all the annotations together with the whole macromolecule (3D-EM map coming from EMDB), the atomic resolution structures fitted into it (coordinates coming from PDB) and the sequences corresponding to each of the structures (from UniProt).},

	Abstract = {The homotetrameric tumor suppressor p53 consists of folded core and tetramerization domains, linked and flanked by intrinsically disordered segments that impede structure analysis by x-ray crystallography and NMR. Here, we solved the quaternary structure of human p53 in solution by a combination of small-angle x-ray scattering, which defined its shape, and NMR, which identified the core domain interfaces and showed that the folded domains had the same structure in the intact protein as in fragments. We combined the solution data with electron microscopy on immobilized samples that provided medium resolution 3D maps. Ab initio and rigid body modeling of scattering data revealed an elongated cross-shaped structure with a pair of loosely coupled core domain dimers at the ends, which are accessible for binding to DNA and partner proteins. The core domains in that open conformation closed around a specific DNA response element to form a compact complex whose structure was independently determined by electron microscopy. The structure of the DNA complex is consistent with that of the complex of four separate core domains and response element fragments solved by x-ray crystallography and contacts identified by NMR. Electron microscopy on the conformationally mobile, unbound p53 selected a minor compact conformation, which resembled the closed conformation, from the ensemble of predominantly open conformations. A multipronged structural approach could be generally useful for the structural characterization of the rapidly growing number of multidomain proteins with intrinsically disordered regions.},

	Abstract = {Three-dimensional electron microscopy allows direct visualization of biological macromolecules close to their native state. The high impact of this technique in the structural biology field is highly correlated with the development of new image processing algorithms. In order to achieve subnanometer resolution, the size and number of images involved in a three-dimensional reconstruction increase and so do computer requirements. New chips integrating multiple processors are hitting the market at a reduced cost. This high-integration, low-cost trend has just begun and is expected to bring real supercomputers to our laboratory desktops in the coming years. This paper proposes a parallel implementation of a computation-intensive algorithm for three-dimensional reconstruction, ART, that takes advantage of the computational power in modern multicore platforms. ART is a sophisticated iterative reconstruction algorithm that has turned out to be well suited for the conditions found in three-dimensional electron microscopy. In view of the performance obtained in this work, these modern platforms are expected to play an important role to face the future challenges in three-dimensional electron microscopy.},

@article{Sorzano:2009ac,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The transmission electron microscope is used to acquire structural information of macromolecular complexes. However, as any other imaging device, it introduces optical aberrations that must be corrected if high-resolution structural information is to be obtained. The set of all aberrations are usually modeled in Fourier space by the so-called Contrast Transfer Function (CTF). Before correcting for the CTF, we must first estimate it from the electron micrographs. This is usually done by estimating a number of parameters specifying a theoretical model of the CTF. This estimation is performed by minimizing some error measure between the theoretical Power Spectrum Density (PSD) and the experimentally observed PSD. The high noise present in the micrographs, the possible local minima of the error function for estimating the CTF parameters, and the cross-talking between CTF parameters may cause errors in the estimated CTF parameters.
RESULTS: In this paper, we explore the effect of these estimation errors on the theoretical CTF. For the CTF model proposed in 1 we show which are the most sensitive CTF parameters as well as the most sensitive background parameters. Moreover, we provide a methodology to reveal the internal structure of the CTF model (which parameters influence in which parameters) and to estimate the accuracy of each model parameter. Finally, we explore the effect of the variability in the detection of the CTF for CTF phase and amplitude correction.
CONCLUSION: We show that the estimation errors for the CTF detection methodology proposed in 1 does not show a significant deterioration of the CTF correction capabilities of subsequent algorithms. All together, the methodology described in this paper constitutes a powerful tool for the quantitative analysis of CTF models that can be applied to other models different from the one analyzed here.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tilt series are commonly used in electron tomography as a means of collecting three-dimensional information from two-dimensional projections. A common problem encountered is the projection alignment prior to 3D reconstruction. Current alignment techniques usually employ gold particles or image derived markers to correctly align the images. When these markers are not present, correlation between adjacent views is used to align them. However, sequential pairwise correlation is prone to bias and the resulting alignment is not always optimal.
RESULTS: In this paper we introduce an algorithm to find regions of the tilt series which can be tracked within a subseries of the tilt series. These regions act as landmarks allowing the determination of the alignment parameters. We show our results with synthetic data as well as experimental cryo electron tomography.
CONCLUSION: Our algorithm is able to correctly align a single-tilt tomographic series without the help of fiducial markers thanks to the detection of thousands of small image patches that can be tracked over a short number of images in the series.},

Unfortunately, this goal requires gathering tens of thousands of projection images that are frequently selected manually from micrographs. In this paper we introduce a new automatic particle selection that learns from the user which particles are of interest. The training phase is semi-supervised so that the user can correct the algorithm during picking and specifically identify incorrectly picked particles. By treating such errors specially, the algorithm attempts to minimize the number of false positives. We show that our algorithm is able to produce datasets with fewer wrongly selected particles than previously reported methods. Another advantage is that we avoid the need for an initial reference volume from which to generate picking projections by instead learning which particles to pick from the user.

In our method, consecutive triples of images are iteratively registered to gradually extend the information through the set of images of the entire sequence. The intermediate results are reused for the registration of the following triple. We choose to interpolate the images and model the deformation fields using B-spline multiresolution pyramids. Novel boundary conditions are introduced to better characterize the deformations at the boundaries. In the experimental section, we quantitatively show that our method recovers from barrel/pincushion and fish-eye deformations with subpixel error. Moreover, it is more robust against outliers--occasional strong noise and large rotations--than the state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we show that our method can be used to realign series of histological serial sections, which are often heavily distorted due to folding and tearing of the tissues.},

In fact, it offers the possibility of imaging three-dimensional structures of hydrated biological specimens near their native state without chemical pre-treatment. Ideally, TomoX reconstructs the specimen absorption coefficients from projections of this specimen, but, unfortunately, X-ray micrographs are only an approximation to projections of the specimen, resulting in inaccuracies if a tomographic reconstruction is performed without explicitly incorporating these approximations.

	Abstract = {In this work we present a fast and automated algorithm for estimating the contrast transfer function (CTF) of a transmission electron microscope. The approach is very suitable for High Throughput work because: (a) it does not require any initial defocus estimation, (b) it is almost an order of magnitude faster than existing approaches, (c) it opens the way to well-defined extensions to the estimation of higher order aberrations, at the same time that provides defocus and astigmatism estimations comparable in accuracy to well established methods, such as Xmipp and CTFFIND3 approaches. The new algorithm is based on obtaining the wrapped modulating phase of the power spectra density pattern by the use of a quadrature filter. This phase is further unwrapped in order to obtain the continuous and smooth absolute phase map; then a Zernike polynomial fitting is performed and the defocus and astigmatism parameters are determined. While the method does not require an initial estimation of the defocus parameters or any non-linear optimization procedure, these approaches can be used if further refinement is desired. Results of the CTF estimation method are presented for standard negative stained images, cryo-electron microscopy images in the absence of carbon support, as well as micrographs with only ice. Additionally, we have also tested the proposed method with micrographs acquired from tilted and untilted samples, obtaining good results. The algorithm is freely available as a part of the Xmipp package [http://xmipp.cnb.csic.es].},

	Abstract = {Three-dimensional reconstruction of biological specimens using electron microscopy by single particle methodologies requires the identification and extraction of the imaged particles from the acquired micrographs. Automatic and semiautomatic particle selection approaches can localize these particles, minimizing the user interaction, but at the cost of selecting a non-negligible number of incorrect particles, which can corrupt the final three-dimensional reconstruction. In this work, we present a novel particle quality assessment and sorting method that can separate most erroneously picked particles from correct ones. The proposed method is based on multivariate statistical analysis of a particle set that has been picked previously using any automatic or manual approach. The new method uses different sets of particle descriptors, which are morphology-based, histogram-based and signal to noise analysis based.

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Structural information of macromolecular complexes provides key insights into the way they carry out their biological functions. Achieving high-resolution structural details with electron microscopy requires the identification of a large number (up to hundreds of thousands) of single particles from electron micrographs, which is a laborious task if it has to be manually done and constitutes a hurdle towards high-throughput. Automatic particle selection in micrographs is far from being settled and new and more robust algorithms are required to reduce the number of false positives and false negatives.
RESULTS: In this article, we introduce an automatic particle picker that learns from the user the kind of particles he is interested in. Particle candidates are quickly and robustly classified as particles or non-particles. A number of new discriminative shape-related features as well as some statistical description of the image grey intensities are used to train two support vector machine classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method: (i) has a considerably low computational complexity and (ii) provides results better or comparable with previously reported methods at a fraction of their computing time.
AVAILABILITY: The algorithm is fully implemented in the open-source Xmipp package and downloadable from http://xmipp.cnb.csic.es.},

In this article we present Xmipp 3.0, a major release which introduces several improvements and new developments over the previous version. A central improvement is the concept of a project that stores the entire processing workflow from data import to final results. It is now possible to monitor, reproduce and restart all computing tasks as well as graphically explore the complete set of interrelated tasks associated to a given project. Other graphical tools have also been improved such as data visualization, particle picking and parameter "wizards" that allow the visual selection of some key parameters. Many standard image formats are transparently supported for input/output from all programs. Additionally, results have been standardized, facilitating the interoperation between different Xmipp programs. Finally, as a result of a large code refactoring, the underlying C++ libraries are better suited for future developments and all code has been optimized. Xmipp is an open-source package that is freely available for download from: http://xmipp.cnb.csic.es.},

Tightly integrated with a relational SQL database, Appion is a modular and transparent pipeline that extends existing software applications and procedures. The user manages and controls the software modules via web-based forms, and all results are similarly available using web-based viewers directly linked to the underlying database, enabling even naive users to quickly deduce the quality of their results.

	Abstract = {The alignment of single-particle images fails at low signal-to-noise ratios and small particle sizes, because noise produces false peaks in the cross-correlation function used for alignment. A maximum-likelihood approach to the two-dimensional alignment problem is described which allows the underlying structure to be estimated from large data sets of very noisy images. Instead of finding the optimum alignment for each image, the algorithm forms a weighted sum over all possible in-plane rotations and translations of the image. The weighting factors, which are the probabilities of the image transformations, are computed as the exponential of a cross-correlation function. Simulated data sets were constructed and processed by the algorithm. The results demonstrate a greatly reduced sensitivity to the choice of a starting reference, and the ability to recover structures from large data sets having very low signal-to-noise ratios.},

	Abstract = {In chlorophyll biosynthesis, insertion of Mg(2+) into protoporphyrin IX is catalysed in an ATP-dependent reaction by a three-subunit (BchI, BchD and BchH) enzyme magnesium chelatase. In this work we present the three-dimensional structure of the ATP-binding subunit BchI. The structure has been solved by the multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion method and refined at 2.1 A resolution to the crystallographic R-factor of 22.2 % (R(free)=24.5 %). It belongs to the chaperone-like "ATPase associated with a variety of cellular activities" (AAA) family of ATPases, with a novel arrangement of domains: the C-terminal helical domain is located behind the nucleotide-binding site, while in other known AAA module structures it is located on the top. Examination by electron microscopy of BchI solutions in the presence of ATP demonstrated that BchI, like other AAA proteins, forms oligomeric ring structures. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of subunit BchD revealed an AAA module at the N-terminal portion of the sequence and an integrin I domain at the C terminus. An acidic, proline-rich region linking these two domains is suggested to contribute to the association of BchI and BchD by binding to a positively charged cleft at the surface of the nucleotide-binding domain of BchI. Analysis of the amino acid sequences of BchI and BchH revealed integrin I domain-binding sequence motifs. These are proposed to bind the integrin I domain of BchD during the functional cycle of magnesium chelatase, linking porphyrin metallation by BchH to ATP hydrolysis by BchI. An integrin I domain and an acidic and proline-rich region have been identified in subunit CobT of cobalt chelatase, clearly demonstrating its homology to BchD. These findings, for the first time, provide an insight into the subunit organisation of magnesium chelatase and the homologous colbalt chelatase.},

@article{Hansson:2002aa,
	Abstract = {Many enzymes of the bacteriochlorophyll and chlorophyll biosynthesis pathways have been conserved throughout evolution, but the molecular mechanisms of the key steps remain unclear. The magnesium chelatase reaction is one of these steps, and it requires the proteins BchI, BchD, and BchH to catalyze the insertion of Mg(2+) into protoporphyrin IX upon ATP hydrolysis. Structural analyses have shown that BchI forms hexamers and belongs to the ATPases associated with various cellular activities (AAA(+)) family of proteins. AAA(+) proteins are Mg(2+)-dependent ATPases that normally form oligomeric ring structures in the presence of ATP. By using ATPase-deficient BchI subunits, we demonstrate that binding of ATP is sufficient to form BchI oligomers. Further, ATPase-deficient BchI proteins can form mixed oligomers with WT BchI. The formation of BchI oligomers is not sufficient for magnesium chelatase activity when combined with BchD and BchH. Combining WT BchI with ATPase-deficient BchI in an assay disrupts the chelatase reaction, but the presence of deficient BchI does not inhibit ATPase activity of the WT BchI. Thus, the ATPase of every WT segment of the hexamer is autonomous, but all segments of the hexamer must be capable of ATP hydrolysis for magnesium chelatase activity. We suggest that ATP hydrolysis of each BchI within the hexamer causes a conformational change of the hexamer as a whole. However, hexamers containing ATPase-deficient BchI are unable to perform this ATP-dependent conformational change, and the magnesium chelatase reaction is stalled in an early stage.},

	Abstract = {Magnesium chelatase inserts Mg2+ into protoporphyrin IX and is the first unique enzyme of the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway. It is a heterotrimeric enzyme, composed of I- (40 kDa), D- (70 kDa) and H- (140 kDa) subunits. The I- and D-proteins belong to the family of AAA+ (ATPases associated with various cellular activities), but only I-subunit hydrolyses ATP to ADP. The D-subunits provide a platform for the assembly of the I-subunits, which results in a two-tiered hexameric ring complex. However, the D-subunits are unstable in the chloroplast unless ATPase active I-subunits are present. The H-subunit binds protoporphyrin and is suggested to be the catalytic subunit. Previous studies have indicated that the H-subunit also has ATPase activity, which is in accordance with an earlier suggested two-stage mechanism of the reaction. In the present study, we demonstrate that gel filtration chromatography of affinity-purified Rhodobacter capsulatus H-subunit produced in Escherichia coli generates a high- and a low-molecular-mass fraction. Both fractions were dominated by the H-subunit, but the ATPase activity was only found in the high-molecular-mass fraction and magnesium chelatase activity was only associated with the low-molecular-mass fraction. We demonstrated that light converted monomeric low-molecular-mass H-subunit into high-molecular-mass aggregates. We conclude that ATP utilization by magnesium chelatase is solely connected to the I-subunit and suggest that a contaminating E. coli protein, which binds to aggregates of the H-subunit, caused the previously reported ATPase activity of the H-subunit.},

The I subunit belongs to the AAA protein superfamily (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) that is known to form hexameric ring structures in an ATP-dependant fashion. Dominant mutations in the I subunit revealed that it functions in a cooperative manner. We demonstrated that the D subunit forms ATP-independent oligomeric structures and should also be classified as an AAA protein. Furthermore, we addressed the question of cooperativity of the D subunit with barley (Hordeum vulgare) mutant analyses. The recessive behavior in vivo was explained by the absence of mutant proteins in the barley cell. Analogous mutations in Rhodobacter capsulatus and the resulting D proteins were studied in vitro. Mixtures of wild-type and mutant R. capsulatus D subunits showed a lower activity compared with wild-type subunits alone. Thus, the mutant D subunits displayed dominant behavior in vitro, revealing cooperativity between the D subunits in the oligomeric state. We propose a model where the D oligomer forms a platform for the stepwise assembly of the I subunits. The cooperative behavior suggests that the D oligomer takes an active part in the conformational dynamics between the subunits of the enzyme.},

	Abstract = {The ATP-dependent insertion of Mg(2+) into protoporphyrin IX is the first committed step in the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway. The reaction is catalyzed by magnesium chelatase, which consists of three gene products: BchI, BchD, and BchH. The BchI and BchD subunits belong to the family of AAA+ proteins (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) and form a two-ring complex with six BchI subunits in one layer and six BchD subunits in the other layer. This BchID complex is a two-layered trimer of dimers with the ATP binding site located at the interface between two neighboring BchI subunits. ATP hydrolysis by the BchID motor unit fuels the insertion of Mg(2+) into the porphyrin by the BchH subunit. In the present study, we explored mutations that were originally identified in semidominant barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) mutants. The resulting recombinant BchI proteins have marginal ATPase activity and cannot contribute to magnesium chelatase activity although they apparently form structurally correct complexes with BchD. Mixing experiments with modified and wild-type BchI in various combinations showed that an exchange of BchI subunits in magnesium chelatase occurs during the catalytic cycle, which indicates that dissociation of the complex may be part of the reaction mechanism related to product release. Mixing experiments also showed that more than three functional interfaces in the BchI ring structure are required for magnesium chelatase activity.},

The goal of this project is to provide software capable of performing single-particle reconstructions beyond 10 A as such high-resolution data become available. A complete single-particle reconstruction algorithm is implemented. Options are available to generate an initial model for particles with no symmetry, a single axis of rotational symmetry, or icosahedral symmetry. Model refinement is an iterative process, which utilizes classification by model-based projection matching. CTF (contrast transfer function) parameters are determined using a new paradigm in which data from multiple micrographs are fit simultaneously. Amplitude and phase CTF correction is then performed automatically as part of the refinement loop. A graphical user interface is provided, so even those with little image processing experience will be able to begin performing reconstructions. Advanced users can directly use the lower level shell commands and even expand the package utilizing EMAN's extensive image-processing library. The package was written from scratch in C++ and is provided free of charge on our Web site. We present an overview of the package as well as several conformance tests with simulated data.},

	Abstract = {Single-particle analysis has become an increasingly important method for structural determination of large macromolecular assemblies. GroEL is an 800 kDa molecular chaperone, which, along with its co-chaperonin GroES, promotes protein folding both in vitro and in the bacterial cell. EMAN is a single-particle analysis software package, which was first publicly distributed in 2000. We present a three-dimensional reconstruction of native naked GroEL to approximately 11.5 A performed entirely with EMAN. We demonstrate that the single-particle reconstruction, X-ray scattering data and X-ray crystal structure all agree well at this resolution. These results validate the specific methods of image restoration, reconstruction and evaluation techniques implemented in EMAN. It also demonstrates that the single-particle reconstruction technique and X-ray crystallography will yield consistent structure factors, even at low resolution, when image restoration is performed correctly. A detailed comparison of the single-particle and X-ray structures exhibits some small variations in the equatorial domain of the molecule, likely due to the absence of crystal packing forces in the single-particle reconstruction.},

	Abstract = {The terminal steps involved in making ATP in mitochondria require an ATP synthase (F(0)F(1)) comprised of two motors, a phosphate carrier (PIC), and an adenine nucleotide carrier (ANC). Under mild conditions, these entities sub-fractionate as an ATP synthase/PIC/ANC complex or "ATP synthasome" (Ko, Y.H., Delannoy, M, Hullihen, J., Chiu, W., and Pedersen, P.L. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 12305-12309). As a first step toward obtaining three-dimensional information about this large complex or "metabolon" and the locations of PIC and ANC therein, we dispersed ATP synthasomes into single complexes and visualized negatively stained images by electron microscopy (EM) that showed clearly the classical headpiece, central stalk, and basepiece. Parallel immuno-EM studies revealed the presence of PIC and ANC located non-centrally in the basepiece, and other studies implicated an ATP synthase/PIC/ANC stoichiometry near 1:1:1. Single ATP synthasome images (7506) were boxed, and, using EMAN software, a three-dimensional model was obtained at a resolution of 23 A. Significantly, the basepiece is oblong and contains two domains, the larger of which connects to the central stalk, whereas the smaller appears as an extension. Docking studies with known structures together with the immuno-EM studies suggest that PIC or ANC may be located in the smaller domain, whereas the other transporter resides nearby in the larger domain. Collectively, these finding support a mechanism in which the entry of the substrates ADP and P(i) into mitochondria, the synthesis of ATP on F(1), and the release and exit of ATP are very localized and highly coordinated events.},

This structure was produced using collected data used for our previous published structures at 22-30 A resolution, but now taking advantage of recent algorithmic improvements in the EMAN software suite. This improved map clearly exhibits more structural detail and allows better defined docking of computationally predicted structural domain folds. Using sequence-based fold recognition, the N-terminal region of RyR1, residues 216-572, was predicted to have significant structural similarity with the IP3-binding core region of the type 1 IP3R. This putative structure was computationally localized to the clamp-shaped region of RyR1, which has been implicated to have a regulatory role in the channel activity.},

It was first released in 1999, and new versions have been released typically 2-3 times each year since that time. EMAN2 has been under development for the last two years, with a completely refactored image processing library, and a wide range of features to make it much more flexible and extensible than EMAN1. The user-level programs are better documented, more straightforward to use, and written in the Python scripting language, so advanced users can modify the programs' behavior without any recompilation. A completely rewritten 3D transformation class simplifies translation between Euler angle standards and symmetry conventions. The core C++ library has over 500 functions for image processing and associated tasks, and it is modular with introspection capabilities, so programmers can add new algorithms with minimal effort and programs can incorporate new capabilities automatically. Finally, a flexible new parallelism system has been designed to address the shortcomings in the rigid system in EMAN1.},

Ideally the TEM specimen will be prepared in vitreous ice (electron cryomicroscopy), but negative stain preparations may be used for lower resolution work. This technique has been demonstrated to produce structures at resolutions as high as ∼ 4 A, though this is not yet typical. The reconstruction process is quite computationally intensive, and several software packages are available for this task.

Although subnanometer resolutions have been routinely achieved for many specimens, state of the art cryo-EM has pushed to near-atomic (3.3-4.6 {\AA}) resolutions. At these resolutions, it is now possible to construct reliable atomic models directly from the cryo-EM density map. In this study, we describe our recently developed protocols for performing the three-dimensional reconstruction and modeling of Mm-cpn, a group II chaperonin, determined to 4.3 {\AA} resolution. This protocol, utilizing the software tools EMAN, Gorgon and Coot, can be adapted for use with nearly all specimens imaged with cryo-EM that target beyond 5 {\AA} resolution. Additionally, the feature recognition and computational modeling tools can be applied to any near-atomic resolution density maps, including those from X-ray crystallography.},

Achieving sub-nanometer resolution is now readily approachable on mid-range microscopes with straightforward data processing, so long as the target specimen meets some basic requirements. Achieving resolutions beyond 0.5 nm currently requires a high-end microscope and careful data acquisition and processing, with much more stringent specimen requirements.

	Abstract = {To achieve cell entry, many nonenveloped viruses must transform from a dormant to a primed state. In contrast to the membrane fusion mechanism of enveloped viruses (e.g., influenza virus), this membrane penetration mechanism is poorly understood. Here, using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, we report a 3.3 A structure of the primed, infectious subvirion particle of aquareovirus. The density map reveals side-chain densities of all types of amino acids (except glycine), enabling construction of a full-atom model of the viral particle. Our structure and biochemical results show that priming involves autocleavage of the membrane penetration protein and suggest that Lys84 and Glu76 may facilitate this autocleavage in a nucleophilic attack. We observe a myristoyl group, covalently linked to the N terminus of the penetration protein and embedded in a hydrophobic pocket. These results suggest a well-orchestrated process of nonenveloped virus entry involving autocleavage of the penetration protein prior to exposure of its membrane-insertion finger.},

Biochemical data have shown that the amino-terminal 79 residues of the CPV turret protein (TP) is sufficient to bring CPV or engineered proteins into the polyhedrin matrix for micro-encapsulation. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of CPV at 3.88 A resolution using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. Our map clearly shows the turns and deep grooves of alpha-helices, the strand separation in beta-sheets, and densities for loops and many bulky side chains; thus permitting atomic model-building effort from cryo-electron microscopy maps. We observed a helix-to-beta-hairpin conformational change between the two conformational states of the capsid shell protein in the region directly interacting with genomic RNA. We have also discovered a messenger RNA release hole coupled with the mRNA capping machinery unique to CPV.

The virion consists of a lipoprotein envelope surrounding an icosahedral capsid composed of dimers of a 183-residue protein, 'core antigen' (HBcAg). Knowledge of its structure is important for the design of antiviral drugs, but it has yet to be determined. Residues 150-183 are known to form a protamine-like domain required for packaging RNA, and residues 1-149 form the 'assembly domain' that polymerizes into capsids and, unusually for a capsid protein, is highly alpha-helical. Density maps calculated from cryo-electron micrographs show that the assembly domain dimer is T-shaped: its stem constitutes the dimer interface and the tips of its arms make the polymerization contacts. By refining the procedures used to calculate the map, we have extended the resolution to 9 A, revealing major elements of secondary structure. In particular, the stem, which protrudes as a spike on the capsid's outer surface, is a 4-helix bundle, formed by the pairing of alpha-helical hairpins from both subunits.},

Sites of cross-linking were determined by tryptic peptide mapping by using time-of-flight MS. Eighteen unique intramolecular lysine (Lys-Lys) cross-links were identified. The assignments for eight cross-linked peptides were confirmed by using post source decay MS. The interatomic distance constraints were all consistent with the tertiary structure of FGF-2. These relatively few constraints, in conjunction with threading, correctly identified FGF-2 as a member of the beta-trefoil fold family. To further demonstrate utility, we used the top-scoring homolog, IL-1beta, to build an FGF-2 homology model with a backbone error of 4.8 A (rms deviation). This method is fast, is general, uses small amounts of material, and is amenable to automation.},

	Abstract = {We benchmark several SVM objective functions for large-scale image classification. We consider one-versus-rest, multiclass, ranking, and weighted approximate ranking SVMs. A comparison of online and batch methods for optimizing the objectives shows that online methods perform as well as batch methods in terms of classification accuracy, but with a significant gain in training speed. Using stochastic gradient descent, we can scale the training to millions of images and thousands of classes. Our experimental evaluation shows that ranking-based algorithms do not outperform the one-versus-rest strategy when a large number of training examples are used. Furthermore, the gap in accuracy between the different algorithms shrinks as the dimension of the features increases. We also show that learning through cross-validation the optimal rebalancing of positive and negative examples can result in a significant improvement for the one-versus-rest strategy. Finally, early stopping can be used as an effective regularization strategy when training with online algorithms. Following these "good practices," we were able to improve the state of the art on a large subset of 10K classes and 9M images of ImageNet from 16.7 percent Top-1 accuracy to 19.1 percent.},

	Abstract = {Current methods of free R factor cross-validation assume that the structure factors of the test and working sets are independent of one another. This assumption is only an approximation when the modeled structure occupies anything less than the full asymmetric unit. Through progressive elimination of reflections from the working set, starting with those expected to be most correlated to the test set, small biases in free R can be measured, presumably because of over-sampling of the Fourier transform owing to bulk solvent in the crystal. This level of bias may be of little practical importance, but it rises to significant levels with increasing non-crystallographic symmetry owing to wider correlations between structure factors than hitherto appreciated. In the presence of 15-fold non-crystallographic symmetry, with resolutions commonly attainable in macromolecular crystallography, it may not be possible to calculate an unbiased free R factor. Methods are developed for the calculation of reduced-bias free R factors through elimination of the strongest correlations between test and working sets. With 180-fold non-crystallographic symmetry they may not be an accurate indicator of absolute quality, but they do yield the correct optimal weighting for stereochemical restraints.},

	Abstract = {Experimental phases could only be obtained to 4.4 A resolution for crystals of the SecA translocation ATPase. Density modification of these phases exploiting the 65% solvent content of the crystal produced a map from which an approximate backbone model could be built for 80% of the structure. Combining the phases inferred from this partial model with the MIR phases and repeating the density modification produced an improved map from which a more complete backbone model could be built. However, this procedure converged before yielding a map, that allowed unambiguous sequence assignment for the majority of the protein molecule. In order to avoid the likely model bias associated with a speculative attempt at sequence assignment, a real-space cross-validation procedure was employed to facilitate completion of the crystal structure based on partial model phasing. The protein was partitioned into two disjoint sets of residues. Models in which the side chains were built for residues in one of the two sets were used for phase combination and density modification in order to produce improved electron density for interpretation of residues in the other set that had not been included in the model. Residues in the two sets were therefore omitted from the model in alternation except at sites where the side chain could be identified definitively based on phasing with the other set. This ping-pong cross-validation procedure allowed partial model phasing to be used to complete the crystal structure of SecA without being impeded by model bias. These results show that the structure of a large protein molecule can be solved with exclusively low-resolution experimental phase information based on intensive use of partial model phasing and density modification. Real-space cross-validation can be applied to reduce the risk of model bias associated with partial model phasing, streamlining this approach and expanding its range of applicability.},

	Abstract = {Cross-validation of a solid-state NMR-derived membrane polypeptide structure is demonstrated. An initial structure has been achieved directly from solid-state NMR derived orientational restraints based on a variety of anisotropic nuclear spin interactions. Refining the molecular structure involves setting up a penalty function that incorporates all available solid-state NMR experimental data and an energy function. A validation method is required to choose the optimal weighting factor for the total penalty function to balance the contribution from the experimental restraints and the energy function. Complete cross-validation has been used to avoid over-fitting the orientational restraints. Such cross-validation involves partitioning of the experimental data into a test set and a working set followed by checking the free R-value during the refinement process. This approach is similar to the method used in crystallography and solution NMR. Optimizing the weighting factor on the penalty function by cross-validation will increase the quality of the refined structure from solid-state NMR data. The complete cross-validation and R-factor calculation is demonstrated using experimental solid-state NMR data from gramicidin A, a monovalent cation channel in lipid bilayers.},

	Abstract = {Single-particle cryo-EM is a powerful approach to determine the structure of large macromolecules and assemblies thereof in many cases at subnanometer resolution. It has become popular to refine or flexibly fit atomic models into density maps derived from cryo-EM experiments. These density maps are typically significantly lower in resolution than electron density maps obtained from X-ray diffraction experiments, such that the number of parameters that need to be determined is much larger than the number of experimental observables. Overfitting and misinterpretation of the density, thus, become a serious problem. For diffraction data, a cross-validation approach was introduced almost 20 y ago; however, no such approach has been described yet for structure refinement against cryo-EM density maps, although the overfitting problem is, because of the lower resolution, significantly larger. We present a cross-validation approach for real-space refinement against cryo-EM density maps in analogy to cross-validation typically used in crystallography. Our approach is able to detect overfitting and allows for optimizing the choice of restraints used in the refinement. The approach is shown on three protein structures with simulated data and experimental data of the rotavirus double-layer particle. Because cross-validation requires splitting the dataset into at least two independent sets, we further present an approach to quantify correlations between the structure factor sets. This analysis is also helpful for other cross-validation applications, such as refinements against diffraction data or 3D reconstructions of cryo-EM density maps.},

	Abstract = {The determination of macromolecular structure by crystallography involves fitting atomic models to the observed diffraction data. The traditional measure of the quality of this fit, and presumably the accuracy of the model, is the R value. Despite stereochemical restraints, it is possible to overfit or 'misfit' the diffraction data: an incorrect model can be refined to fairly good R values as several recent examples have shown. Here I propose a reliable and unbiased indicator of the accuracy of such models. By analogy with the cross-validation method of testing statistical models I define a statistical quantity (R(free) (T) that measures the agreement between observed and computed structure factor amplitudes for a 'test' set of reflections that is omitted in the modelling and refinement process. As examples show, there is a high correlation between R(free) (T) and the accuracy of the atomic model phases. This is useful because experimental phase information is usually inaccurate, incomplete or unavailable. I expect that R(free) (T) will provide a measure of the information content of recently proposed models of thermal motion and disorder, time-averaging and bulk solvent.},

	Abstract = {Large rigid-body domain movements are critical to GroEL-mediated protein folding, especially apical domain elevation and twist associated with the formation of a folding chamber upon binding ATP and co-chaperonin GroES. Here, we have modeled the anisotropic displacements of GroEL domains from various crystallized states, unliganded GroEL, ATPgammaS-bound, ADP-AlFx/GroES-bound, and ADP/GroES bound, using translation-libration-screw (TLS) analysis. Remarkably, the TLS results show that the inherent motions of unliganded GroEL, a polypeptide-accepting state, are biased along the transition pathway that leads to the folding-active state. In the ADP-AlFx/GroES-bound folding-active state the dynamic modes of the apical domains become reoriented and coupled to the motions of bound GroES. The ADP/GroES complex exhibits these same motions, but they are increased in magnitude, potentially reflecting the decreased stability of the complex after nucleotide hydrolysis. Our results have allowed the visualization of the anisotropic molecular motions that link the static conformations previously observed by X-ray crystallography. Application of the same analyses to other macromolecules where rigid body motions occur may give insight into the large scale dynamics critical for function and thus has the potential to extend our fundamental understanding of molecular machines.},

	Abstract = {Obtaining phases for X-ray diffraction data can be a rate-limiting step in structure determination. Taking advantage of constraints specific to membrane proteins, an ab initio molecular-replacement method has been developed for phasing X-ray diffraction data for symmetric helical membrane proteins without prior knowledge of their structure or heavy-atom derivatives. The described method is based on generating all possible orientations of idealized transmembrane helices and using each model in a molecular-replacement search. The number of models is significantly reduced by taking advantage of geometrical and structural restraints specific to membrane proteins. The top molecular-replacement results are evaluated based on noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) map correlation, OMIT map correlation and R(free) value after refinement of a polyalanine model. The feasibility of this approach is illustrated by phasing the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) with only 4 A diffraction data. No prior structural knowledge was used other than the number of transmembrane helices. The search produced the correct spatial organization and the position in the asymmetric unit of all transmembrane helices of MscL. The resulting electron-density maps were of sufficient quality to automatically build all helical segments of MscL including the cytoplasmic domain. The method does not require high-resolution diffraction data and can be used to obtain phases for symmetrical helical membrane proteins with one or two helices per monomer.},

This model enabled rerefinement of full-length p97 in different nucleotide states against previously reported low-resolution diffraction data to significantly improved R values and Ramachandran statistics. Although the overall fold remained similar, there are significant improvements, especially around the D2 nucleotide binding site. The rerefinement illustrates the importance of knowledge of high-resolution structures of fragments covering most of the whole molecule. The structures suggest that nucleotide hydrolysis is transformed into larger conformational changes by pushing of one D2 domain by its neighbor in the hexamer, and transmission of nucleotide-state information through the D1-D2 linker to displace the N-terminal, effector binding domain.},

The structures were originally solved by molecular replacement with the high-resolution structure of the N-D1 fragment of p97/VCP, whereas the D2 domain was manually built using its homology to the D1 domain as a guide. The structure of the D2 domain alone was subsequently solved at 3 A resolution. The refined model of D2 and the high-resolution structure of the N-D1 fragment were then used as starting models for re-refinement against the low-resolution diffraction data for full-length p97. The re-refined full-length models showed significant improvement in both secondary structure and R values. The free R values dropped by as much as 5% compared with the original structure refinements, indicating that refinement is meaningful at low resolution and that there is information in the diffraction data even at approximately 4 A resolution that objectively assesses the quality of the model. It is concluded that de novo model building is problematic at low resolution and refinement should start from high-resolution crystal structures whenever possible.},

	Abstract = {X-ray diffraction plays a pivotal role in the understanding of biological systems by revealing atomic structures of proteins, nucleic acids and their complexes, with much recent interest in very large assemblies like the ribosome. As crystals of such large assemblies often diffract weakly (resolution worse than 4 A), we need methods that work at such low resolution. In macromolecular assemblies, some of the components may be known at high resolution, whereas others are unknown: current refinement methods fail as they require a high-resolution starting structure for the entire complex. Determining the structure of such complexes, which are often of key biological importance, should be possible in principle as the number of independent diffraction intensities at a resolution better than 5 A generally exceeds the number of degrees of freedom. Here we introduce a method that adds specific information from known homologous structures but allows global and local deformations of these homology models. Our approach uses the observation that local protein structure tends to be conserved as sequence and function evolve. Cross-validation with R(free) (the free R-factor) determines the optimum deformation and influence of the homology model. For test cases at 3.5-5 A resolution with known structures at high resolution, our method gives significant improvements over conventional refinement in the model as monitored by coordinate accuracy, the definition of secondary structure and the quality of electron density maps. For re-refinements of a representative set of 19 low-resolution crystal structures from the Protein Data Bank, we find similar improvements. Thus, a structure derived from low-resolution diffraction data can have quality similar to a high-resolution structure. Our method is applicable to the study of weakly diffracting crystals using X-ray micro-diffraction as well as data from new X-ray light sources. Use of homology information is not restricted to X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy: as optical imaging advances to subnanometre resolution, it can use similar tools.},

	Abstract = {Most current crystallographic structure refinements augment the diffraction data with a priori information consisting of bond, angle, dihedral, planarity restraints, and atomic repulsion based on the Pauli exclusion principle. Yet, electrostatics and van der Waals attraction are physical forces that provide additional a priori information. Here, we assess the inclusion of electrostatics for the force field used for all-atom (including hydrogen) joint neutron/X-ray refinement. Two DNA and a protein crystal structure were refined against joint neutron/X-ray diffraction data sets using force fields without electrostatics or with electrostatics. Hydrogen-bond orientation/geometry favors the inclusion of electrostatics. Refinement of Z-DNA with electrostatics leads to a hypothesis for the entropic stabilization of Z-DNA that may partly explain the thermodynamics of converting the B form of DNA to its Z form. Thus, inclusion of electrostatics assists joint neutron/X-ray refinements, especially for placing and orienting hydrogen atoms.},

The PDB has expanded massively since current criteria for validation of deposited structures were adopted, allowing a much more sophisticated understanding of all the components of macromolecular crystals. The size of the PDB creates new opportunities to validate structures by comparison with the existing database, and the now-mandatory deposition of structure factors creates new opportunities to validate the underlying diffraction data. These developments highlighted the need for a new assessment of validation criteria. The Task Force recommends that a small set of validation data be presented in an easily understood format, relative to both the full PDB and the applicable resolution class, with greater detail available to interested users. Most importantly, we recommend that referees and editors judging the quality of structural experiments have access to a concise summary of well-established quality indicators.},

	Abstract = {Phasing by molecular replacement remains difficult for targets that are far from the search model or in situations where the crystal diffracts only weakly or to low resolution. Here, the process of determining and refining the structure of Cgl1109, a putative succinyl-diaminopimelate desuccinylase from Corynebacterium glutamicum, at ∼3 {\AA} resolution is described using a combination of homology modeling with MODELLER, molecular-replacement phasing with Phaser, deformable elastic network (DEN) refinement and automated model building using AutoBuild in a semi-automated fashion, followed by final refinement cycles with phenix.refine and Coot. This difficult molecular-replacement case illustrates the power of including DEN restraints derived from a starting model to guide the movements of the model during refinement. The resulting improved model phases provide better starting points for automated model building and produce more significant difference peaks in anomalous difference Fourier maps to locate anomalous scatterers than does standard refinement. This example also illustrates a current limitation of automated procedures that require manual adjustment of local sequence misalignments between the homology model and the target sequence.},

We compared refinement methods using synchrotron diffraction data of photosystem I at 7.4 {\AA} resolution, starting from different initial models with increasing deviations from the known high-resolution structure. Standard refinement spoiled the initial models, moving them further away from the true structure and leading to high R(free)-values. In contrast, DEN refinement improved even the most distant starting model as judged by R(free), atomic root-mean-square differences to the true structure, significance of features not included in the initial model, and connectivity of electron density. The best protocol was DEN refinement with initial segmented rigid-body refinement. For the most distant initial model, the fraction of atoms within 2 {\AA} of the true structure improved from 24% to 60%. We also found a significant correlation between R(free) values and the accuracy of the model, suggesting that R(free) is useful even at low resolution.},

	Abstract = {An approach is presented for addressing the challenge of model rebuilding after molecular replacement in cases where the placed template is very different from the structure to be determined. The approach takes advantage of the observation that a template and target structure may have local structures that can be superimposed much more closely than can their complete structures. A density-guided procedure for deformation of a properly placed template is introduced. A shift in the coordinates of each residue in the structure is calculated based on optimizing the match of model density within a 6 {\AA} radius of the center of that residue with a prime-and-switch electron-density map. The shifts are smoothed and applied to the atoms in each residue, leading to local deformation of the template that improves the match of map and model. The model is then refined to improve the geometry and the fit of model to the structure-factor data. A new map is then calculated and the process is repeated until convergence. The procedure can extend the routine applicability of automated molecular replacement, model building and refinement to search models with over 2 {\AA} r.m.s.d. representing 65-100% of the structure.},

In this work, we examine bootstrap techniques for classifying the projection data. When these techniques are applied to variance estimation, the projection images (particles) are randomly sampled with replacement from the data set and a bootstrap volume is reconstructed from each sample. In a recent extension of the bootstrap technique to classification, each particle is assigned to a volume in the space spanned by the bootstrap volumes, such that the projection of the assigned volume best matches the particle. In this work we explain the rationale of these techniques by discussing the nature of the bootstrap volumes and provide some statistical analyses.},

	Abstract = {Biological macromolecules can adopt multiple conformational and compositional states due to structural flexibility and alternative subunit assemblies. This structural heterogeneity poses a major challenge in the study of macromolecular structure using single-particle electron microscopy. We propose a fully automated, unsupervised method for the three-dimensional reconstruction of multiple structural models from heterogeneous data. As a starting reference, our method employs an initial structure that does not account for any heterogeneity. Then, a multi-stage clustering is used to create multiple models representative of the heterogeneity within the sample. The multi-stage clustering combines an existing approach based on Multivariate Statistical Analysis to perform clustering within individual Euler angles, and a newly developed approach to sort out class averages from individual Euler angles into homogeneous groups. Structural models are computed from individual clusters. The whole data classification is further refined using an iterative multi-model projection-matching approach. We tested our method on one synthetic and three distinct experimental datasets. The tests include the cases where a macromolecular complex exhibits structural flexibility and cases where a molecule is found in ligand-bound and unbound states. We propose the use of our approach as an efficient way to reconstruct distinct multiple models from heterogeneous data.},

Classification of cryo-EM data according to the different conformations is difficult because of the coexistence of multiple orientations in a single dataset. Here, we present an unsupervised classification method, termed cluster tracking, which utilizes the continuity in multi-dimensional space induced by angular adjacency of projections in large datasets. In a proof of concept, the testing of cluster tracking on simulated projection data, which were generated from multiple conformations and orientations of an existing volume, produced clusters that are consistent with the conformational identity of the data. The application of the method to experimental cryo-EM projection data is found to result in a partition similar to the one generated by supervised classification.},

The resulting electron density maps show MDH associated in several characteristic binding topologies either deep inside the cavity or at its inlet, contacting three to four consecutive GroEL apical domains. Consistent with visualization of bound polypeptide distributed over many parts of the central cavity, disulfide crosslinking could be carried out between a cysteine in a bound substrate protein and cysteines substituted anywhere inside GroEL. Finally, substrate binding induced adjustments in GroEL itself, observed mainly as clustering together of apical domains around sites of substrate binding.},

	Abstract = {Progress in molecular structure determination by cryo electron microscopy and single particle analysis has led to improvements in the resolution achievable. However, in many cases the limiting factor is structural heterogeneity of the sample. To address this problem, we have developed a method based on statistical analysis of the two-dimensional images to detect and sort localised structural variations caused, for example, by variable occupancy of a ligand. Images are sorted by two consecutive stages of multivariate statistical analysis (MSA) to dissect out the two main sources of variation, namely out of plane orientation and local structural changes. Heterogeneity caused by local changes is detected by MSA that reveals significant peaks in the higher order eigenimages. The eigenimages revealing local peaks are used for automated classification. Evaluation of differences between classes allows discrimination of molecular images with and without ligand. This method is very rapid, independent of any initial three-dimensional model, and can detect even minor subpopulations in an image ensemble. A strategy for using this technique was developed on model data sets. Here, we demonstrate the successful application of this method to both model and real EM data on chaperonin-substrate and ribosome-ligand complexes.},

	Abstract = {How folding of proteins is coupled to their synthesis remains poorly understood. Here, we apply single-molecule fluorescence imaging to full protein synthesis in vitro. Ribosomes were specifically immobilized onto glass surfaces and synthesis of green fluorescent protein (GFP) was achieved using modified commercial Protein Synthesis using Recombinant Elements that lacked ribosomes but contained purified factors and enzyme that are required for translation in Escherichia coli. Translation was monitored using a GFP mutant (F64L/S65T/F99S/M153T/V163A) that has a high fluorophore maturation rate and that contained the Secretion Monitor arrest sequence to prevent dissociation from the ribosome. Immobilized ribosomal subunits were labeled with Cy3 and GFP synthesis was measured by colocalization of GFP fluorescence with the ribosome position. The rate of appearance of colocalized ribosome GFP was equivalent to the rates of fluorescence appearance coupled with translation measured in bulk, and the ribosome-polypeptide complexes were stable for hours. The methods presented here are applicable to single-molecule investigation of translational initiation, elongation and cotranslational folding.},

	Abstract = {Our current understanding of the mechanism of translation is based on nearly fifty years of biochemical and biophysical studies. This mechanism, which requires the ribosome to manipulate tRNA and step repetitively along the mRNA, implies movement. High-resolution structures of the ribosome and its ligands have recently described translation in atomic detail, capturing the endpoints of large-scale rearrangements of the ribosome. Direct observation of the dynamic events that underlie the mechanism of translation is challenged by ensemble averaging in bulk solutions. Single-molecule methods, which eliminate these averaging effects, have emerged as powerful tools to probe the mechanism of translation. Single-molecule fluorescence experiments have described the dynamic motion of the ribosome and tRNA. Single-molecule force measurements have directly probed the forces stabilizing ribosomal complexes. Recent developments have allowed real-time observation of ribosome movement and dynamics during translation. This review covers the contributions of single-molecule studies to our understanding of the dynamic nature of translation.},

	Abstract = {Translation by the ribosome occurs by a complex mechanism involving the coordinated interaction of multiple nucleic acid and protein ligands. Here we use zero-mode waveguides (ZMWs) and sophisticated detection instrumentation to allow real-time observation of translation at physiologically relevant micromolar ligand concentrations. Translation at each codon is monitored by stable binding of transfer RNAs (tRNAs)-labelled with distinct fluorophores-to translating ribosomes, which allows direct detection of the identity of tRNA molecules bound to the ribosome and therefore the underlying messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence. We observe the transit of tRNAs on single translating ribosomes and determine the number of tRNA molecules simultaneously bound to the ribosome, at each codon of an mRNA molecule. Our results show that ribosomes are only briefly occupied by two tRNA molecules and that release of deacylated tRNA from the exit (E) site is uncoupled from binding of aminoacyl-tRNA site (A-site) tRNA and occurs rapidly after translocation. The methods outlined here have broad application to the study of mRNA sequences, and the mechanism and regulation of translation.},

Single molecule fluorescence approaches allowed direct observation of the structural rearrangements occurring during translation and revealed dynamic motions of the ribosome and its ligands. These studies demonstrated how ligand binding affects dynamics of the ribosome, and the role of the conformational sampling in large-scale rearrangements intrinsic to translation elongation. The application of time-resolved cryo-electron microscopy revealed new conformational intermediates during back-translocation providing an insight into ribosomal dynamics from an alternative perspective. Recent developments permitted examination of conformational and compositional dynamics of the ribosome in real-time through multiple cycles of elongation at the single molecule level. The zero-mode waveguide approach allowed direct observation of the compositional dynamics of tRNA occupancy on the elongating ribosome. The emergence of single molecule in vivo techniques provided insights into the mechanism and regulation of translation at the organismal level.},

	Abstract = {Translocation is one of the key events in translation, requiring large-scale conformational changes in the ribosome, movements of two transfer RNAs (tRNAs) across a distance of more than 20{\AA}, and the coupled movement of the messenger RNA (mRNA) by one codon, completing one cycle of peptide-chain elongation. Translocation is catalyzed by elongation factor G (EF-G in bacteria), which hydrolyzes GTP in the process. However, how the conformational rearrangements of the ribosome actually drive the movements of the tRNAs and how EF-G GTP hydrolysis plays a role in this process are still unclear. Fluorescence methods, both single-molecule and bulk, have provided a dynamic view of translocation, allowing us to follow the different conformational changes of the ribosome in real-time. The application of electron microscopy has revealed new conformational intermediates during translocation and important structural rearrangements in the ribosome that drive tRNA movement, while computational approaches have added quantitative views of the translational pathway. These recent advances shed light on the process of translocation, providing insight on how to resolve the different descriptions of translocation in the current literature.},

Rich structural studies have provided detailed snapshots of the translational machinery at all phases of the translation cycle. However, the relationship between structural dynamics, composition, and function remains unknown. The multistep nature of each stage of the translation cycle results in rapid desynchronization of individual ribosomes, thus hindering elucidation of the underlying mechanisms by conventional bulk biophysical and biochemical methods. Single-molecule approaches unsusceptible to these complications have led to the first glances at both compositional and conformational dynamics on the ribosome and their impact on translational control. These experiments provide the necessary link between static structure and mechanism, often providing new perspectives.

	Abstract = {We describe a fast and accurate direct Fourier method for reconstructing a function f of three variables from a number of its parallel beam projections. The main application of our method is in single particle analysis, where the goal is to reconstruct the mass density of a biological macromolecule. Typically, the number of projections is extremely large, and each projection is extremely noisy. The projection directions are random and initially unknown. However, it is possible to determine both the directions and f by an iterative procedure; during each stage of the iteration, one has to solve a reconstruction problem of the type considered here. Our reconstruction algorithm is distinguished from other direct Fourier methods by the use of gridding techniques that provide an efficient means to compute a uniformly sampled version of a function g from a nonuniformly sampled version of Fg, the Fourier transform of g, or vice versa. We apply the two-dimensional reverse gridding method to each available projection of f, the function to be reconstructed, in order to obtain Ff on a special spherical grid. Then we use the three-dimensional gridding method to reconstruct f from this sampled version of Ff. This stage requires a proper weighting of the samples of Ff to compensate for their nonuniform distribution. We use a fast method for computing appropriate weights that exploits the special properties of the spherical sampling grid for Ff and involves the computation of a Voronoi diagram on the unit sphere. We demonstrate the excellent speed and accuracy of our method by using simulated data.},

It has a sensor layer and a layer of readout electronics, in which each 55 microm x 55 microm pixel has upper and lower energy discrimination and MHz rate counting. The sensor layer consists of a 300 microm slab of pixellated monolithic silicon and this is bonded to the readout chip. Experimental measurement of the detective quantum efficiency, DQE(0) at 120 keV shows that it can reach approximately 85% independent of electron exposure, since the detector has zero noise, and the DQE(Nyquist) can reach approximately 35% of that expected for a perfect detector (4/pi(2)). Experimental measurement of the modulation transfer function (MTF) at Nyquist resolution for 120 keV electrons using a 60 keV lower energy threshold, yields a value that is 50% of that expected for a perfect detector (2/pi). Finally, Monte Carlo simulations of electron tracks and energy deposited in adjacent pixels have been performed and used to calculate expected values for the MTF and DQE as a function of the threshold energy. The good agreement between theory and experiment allows suggestions for further improvements to be made with confidence. The present detector is already very useful for experiments that require a high DQE at very low doses.},

We present MTF and DQE measurements for four types of detector: Kodak SO-163 film, TVIPS 224 charge coupled device (CCD) detector, the Medipix2 hybrid pixel detector, and an experimental direct electron monolithic active pixel sensor (MAPS) detector. Film and CCD performance was measured at 120 and 300 keV, while results are presented for the Medipix2 at 120 keV and for the MAPS detector at 300 keV. In the case of film, the effects of electron backscattering from both the holder and the plastic support have been investigated. We also show that part of the response of the emulsion in film comes from light generated in the plastic support. Computer simulations of film and the MAPS detector have been carried out and show good agreement with experiment. The agreement enables us to conclude that the DQE of a backthinned direct electron MAPS detector is likely to be equal to, or better than, that of film at 300 keV.},

	Abstract = {The advantages of backthinning monolithic active pixel sensors (MAPS) based on complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) direct electron detectors for electron microscopy have been discussed previously; they include better spatial resolution (modulation transfer function or MTF) and efficiency at all spatial frequencies (detective quantum efficiency or DQE). It was suggested that a 'thin' CMOS detector would have the most outstanding properties [1-3] because of a reduction in the proportion of backscattered electrons. In this paper we show, theoretically (using Monte Carlo simulations of electron trajectories) and experimentally that this is indeed the case. The modulation transfer functions of prototype backthinned CMOS direct electron detectors have been measured at 300keV. At zero spatial frequency, in non-backthinned 700-mum-thick detectors, the backscattered component makes up over 40% of the total signal but, by backthinning to 100, 50 or 35mum, this can be reduced to 25%, 15% and 10%, respectively. For the 35mum backthinned detector, this reduction in backscatter increases the MTF by 40% for spatial frequencies between 0.1 and 1.0 Nyquist. As discussed in the main text, reducing backscattering in backthinned detectors should also improve DQE.},

	Abstract = {Quantitative analysis of electron microscope images of organic and biological two-dimensional crystals has previously shown that the absolute contrast reached only a fraction of that expected theoretically from the electron diffraction amplitudes. The accepted explanation for this is that irradiation of the specimen causes beam-induced charging or movement, which in turn causes blurring of the image due to image or specimen movement. In this paper, we used three different approaches to try to overcome this image-blurring problem in monolayer crystals of paraffin. Our first approach was to use an extreme form of spotscan imaging, in which a single image was assembled on film by the successive illumination of up to 50,000 spots, each of a diameter of around 7 nm. The second approach was to use the Medipix II detector with its zero-noise readout to assemble a time-sliced series of images of the same area in which each frame from a movie with up to 400 frames had an exposure of only 500 electrons. In the third approach, we simply used a much thicker carbon support film to increase the physical strength and conductivity of the support. Surprisingly, the first two methods involving dose fractionation in space or time produced only partial improvements in contrast whereas the third approach produced many virtually perfect images, where the absolute contrast predicted from the electron diffraction amplitudes was observed in the images. We conclude that it is possible to obtain consistently almost perfect images of beam-sensitive specimens if they are attached to an appropriately strong and conductive support; however great care is needed in practice and the problem remains of how to best image ice-embedded biological structures in the absence of a strong, conductive support film.},

@article{Sandercock:2011aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) is approved in Europe for use in patients with acute ischaemic stroke who meet strictly defined criteria. IST-3 sought to improve the external validity and precision of the estimates of the overall treatment effects (efficacy and safety) of rtPA in acute ischaemic stroke, and to determine whether a wider range of patients might benefit.
DESIGN: International, multi-centre, prospective, randomized, open, blinded endpoint (PROBE) trial of intravenous rtPA in acute ischaemic stroke. Suitable patients had to be assessed and able to start treatment within 6 hours of developing symptoms, and brain imaging must have excluded intracranial haemorrhage and stroke mimics.
RESULTS: The initial pilot phase was double blind and then, on 01/08/2003, changed to an open design. Recruitment began on 05/05/2000 and closed on 31/07/2011, by which time 3035 patients had been included, only 61 (2%) of whom met the criteria for the 2003 European approval for thrombolysis. 1617 patients were aged over 80 years at trial entry. The analysis plan will be finalised, without reference to the unblinded data, and published before the trial data are unblinded in early 2012. The main trial results will be presented at the European Stroke Conference in Lisbon in May 2012 with the aim to publish simultaneously in a peer-reviewed journal. The trial result will be presented in the context of an updated Cochrane systematic review. We also intend to include the trial data in an individual patient data meta-analysis of all the relevant randomised trials.
CONCLUSION: The data from the trial will: improve the external validity and precision of the estimates of the overall treatment effects (efficacy and safety) of iv rtPA in acute ischaemic stroke; provide: new evidence on the balance of risk and benefit of intravenous rtPA among types of patients who do not clearly meet the terms of the current EU approval; and, provide the first large-scale randomised evidence on effects in patients over 80, an age group which had largely been excluded from previous acute stroke trials.

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Thrombolysis is of net benefit in patients with acute ischaemic stroke, who are younger than 80 years of age and are treated within 4·5 h of onset. The third International Stroke Trial (IST-3) sought to determine whether a wider range of patients might benefit up to 6 h from stroke onset.
METHODS: In this international, multicentre, randomised, open-treatment trial, patients were allocated to 0·9 mg/kg intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) or to control. The primary analysis was of the proportion of patients alive and independent, as defined by an Oxford Handicap Score (OHS) of 0-2 at 6 months. The study is registered, ISRCTN25765518.
FINDINGS: 3035 patients were enrolled by 156 hospitals in 12 countries. All of these patients were included in the analyses (1515 in the rt-PA group vs 1520 in the control group), of whom 1617 (53%) were older than 80 years of age. At 6 months, 554 (37%) patients in the rt-PA group versus 534 (35%) in the control group were alive and independent (OHS 0-2; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1·13, 95% CI 0·95-1·35, p=0·181; a non-significant absolute increase of 14/1000, 95% CI -20 to 48). An ordinal analysis showed a significant shift in OHS scores; common OR 1·27 (95% CI 1·10-1·47, p=0·001). Fatal or non-fatal symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage within 7 days occurred in 104 (7%) patients in the rt-PA group versus 16 (1%) in the control group (adjusted OR 6·94, 95% CI 4·07-11·8; absolute excess 58/1000, 95% CI 44-72). More deaths occurred within 7 days in the rt-PA group (163 [11%]) than in the control group (107 [7%], adjusted OR 1·60, 95% CI 1·22-2·08, p=0·001; absolute increase 37/1000, 95% CI 17-57), but between 7 days and 6 months there were fewer deaths in the rt-PA group than in the control group, so that by 6 months, similar numbers, in total, had died (408 [27%] in the rt-PA group vs 407 [27%] in the control group).
INTERPRETATION: For the types of patient recruited in IST-3, despite the early hazards, thrombolysis within 6 h improved functional outcome. Benefit did not seem to be diminished in elderly patients.

@article{Henderson:2013aa,
	Abstract = {Theoretical considerations together with simulations of single-particle electron cryomicroscopy images of biological assemblies in ice demonstrate that atomic structures should be obtainable from images of a few thousand asymmetric units, provided the molecular weight of the whole assembly being studied is greater than the minimum needed for accurate position and orientation determination. However, with present methods of specimen preparation and current microscope and detector technologies, many more particles are needed, and the alignment of smaller assemblies is difficult or impossible. Only larger structures, with enough signal to allow good orientation determination and with enough images to allow averaging of many hundreds of thousands or even millions of asymmetric units, have successfully produced high-resolution maps. In this review, we compare the contrast of experimental electron cryomicroscopy images of two smaller molecular assemblies, namely apoferritin and beta-galactosidase, with that expected from perfect simulated images calculated from their known X-ray structures. We show that the contrast and signal-to-noise ratio of experimental images still require significant improvement before it will be possible to realize the full potential of single-particle electron cryomicroscopy. In particular, although reasonably good orientations can be obtained for beta-galactosidase, we have been unable to obtain reliable orientation determination from experimental images of apoferritin. Simulations suggest that at least 2-fold improvement of the contrast in experimental images at ~10 {\AA} resolution is needed and should be possible.},

@article{Chen:2013aa,
	Abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) structure determination by single particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) involves the calculation of an initial 3D model, followed by extensive iterative improvement of the orientation determination of the individual particle images and the resulting 3D map. Because there is much more noise than signal at high resolution in the images, this creates the possibility of noise reinforcement in the 3D map, which can give a false impression of the resolution attained. The balance between signal and noise in the final map at its limiting resolution depends on the image processing procedure and is not easily predicted. There is a growing awareness in the cryoEM community of how to avoid such over-fitting and over-estimation of resolution. Equally, there has been a reluctance to use the two principal methods of avoidance because they give lower resolution estimates, which some people believe are too pessimistic. Here we describe a simple test that is compatible with any image processing protocol. The test allows measurement of the amount of signal and the amount of noise from overfitting that is present in the final 3D map. We have applied the method to two different sets of cryoEM images of the enzyme beta-galactosidase using several image processing packages. Our procedure involves substituting the Fourier components of the initial particle image stack beyond a chosen resolution by either the Fourier components from an adjacent area of background, or by simple randomisation of the phases of the particle structure factors. This substituted noise thus has the same spectral power distribution as the original data. Comparison of the Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) plots from the 3D map obtained using the experimental data with that from the same data with high-resolution noise (HR-noise) substituted allows an unambiguous measurement of the amount of overfitting and an accompanying resolution assessment. A simple formula can be used to calculate an unbiased FSC from the two curves, even when a substantial amount of overfitting is present. The approach is software independent. The user is therefore completely free to use any established method or novel combination of methods, provided the HR-noise test is carried out in parallel. Applying this procedure to cryoEM images of beta-galactosidase shows how overfitting varies greatly depending on the procedure, but in the best case shows no overfitting and a resolution of ~6 {\AA}.

	Abstract = {Electron cryo-microscopy of 'single particles' is a powerful method to determine the three-dimensional (3D) architectures of complex cellular assemblies. The pyruvate dehydrogenase multi-enzyme complex couples the activity of three component enzymes (E1, E2 and E3) in the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to generate acetyl-CoA, linking glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. We report here a 3D model for an 11 MDa, icosahedral pyruvate dehydrogenase sub-complex, obtained by combining a 28 A structure derived from electron cryo-microscopy with previously determined atomic coordinates of the individual E1 and E2 components. A key feature is that the E1 molecules are located on the periphery of the assembly in an orientation that allows each of the 60 mobile lipoyl domains tethered to the inner E2 core to access multiple E1 and E2 active sites from inside the icosahedral complex. This unexpected architecture provides a highly efficient mechanism for active site coupling and catalytic rate enhancement by the motion of the lipoyl domains in the restricted annular region between the inner core and outer shell of the complex.},

	Abstract = {A computational procedure is described for assigning the absolute hand of the structure of a protein or assembly determined by single-particle electron microscopy. The procedure requires a pair of micrographs of the same particle field recorded at two tilt angles of a single tilt-axis specimen holder together with the three-dimensional map whose hand is being determined. For orientations determined from particles on one micrograph using the map, the agreement (average phase residual) between particle images on the second micrograph and map projections is determined for all possible choices of tilt angle and axis. Whether the agreement is better at the known tilt angle and axis of the microscope or its inverse indicates whether the map is of correct or incorrect hand. An increased discrimination of correct from incorrect hand (free hand difference), as well as accurate identification of the known values for the tilt angle and axis, can be used as targets for rapidly optimizing the search or refinement procedures used to determine particle orientations. Optimized refinement reduces the tendency for the model to match noise in a single image, thus improving the accuracy of the orientation determination and therefore the quality of the resulting map. The hand determination and refinement optimization procedure is applied to image pairs of the dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2) catalytic core of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex from Bacillus stearothermophilus taken by low-dose electron cryomicroscopy. Structure factor amplitudes of a three-dimensional map of the E2 catalytic core obtained by averaging untilted images of 3667 icosahedral particles are compared to a scattering reference using a Guinier plot. A noise-dependent structure factor weight is derived and used in conjunction with a temperature factor (B=-1000A(2)) to restore high-resolution contrast without amplifying noise and to visualize molecular features to 8.7A resolution, according to a new objective criterion for resolution assessment proposed here.},

	Abstract = {The pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complexes are among the largest multifunctional catalytic machines in cells, catalyzing the production of acetyl CoA from pyruvate. We have previously reported the molecular architecture of an 11-MDa subcomplex comprising the 60-mer icosahedral dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2) decorated with 60 copies of the heterotetrameric (alpha(2)beta(2)) 153-kDa pyruvate decarboxylase (E1) from Bacillus stearothermophilus (Milne, J. L. S., Shi, D., Rosenthal, P. B., Sunshine, J. S., Domingo, G. J., Wu, X., Brooks, B. R., Perham, R. N., Henderson, R., and Subramaniam, S. (2002) EMBO J. 21, 5587-5598). An annular gap of approximately 90 A separates the acetyltransferase catalytic domains of the E2 from an outer shell formed of E1 tetramers. Using cryoelectron microscopy, we present here a three-dimensional reconstruction of the E2 core decorated with 60 copies of the homodimeric 100-kDa dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3). The E2E3 complex has a similar annular gap of approximately 75 A between the inner icosahedral assembly of acetyltransferase domains and the outer shell of E3 homodimers. Automated fitting of the E3 coordinates into the map suggests excellent correspondence between the density of the outer shell map and the positions of the two best fitting orientations of E3. As in the case of E1 in the E1E2 complex, the central 2-fold axis of the E3 homodimer is roughly oriented along the periphery of the shell, making the active sites of the enzyme accessible from the annular gap between the E2 core and the outer shell. The similarities in architecture of the E1E2 and E2E3 complexes indicate fundamental similarities in the mechanism of active site coupling involved in the two key stages requiring motion of the swinging lipoyl domain across the annular gap, namely the synthesis of acetyl CoA and regeneration of the dithiolane ring of the lipoyl domain.},

	Abstract = {Advances in single particle electron cryomicroscopy have made possible to elucidate routinely the structure of biological specimens at subnanometer resolution. At this resolution, secondary structure elements are discernable by their signature. However, identification and interpretation of high resolution structural features are hindered by the contrast loss caused by experimental and computational factors. This contrast loss is traditionally modeled by a Gaussian decay of structure factors with a temperature factor, or B-factor. Standard restoration procedures usually sharpen the experimental maps either by applying a Gaussian function with an inverse ad hoc B-factor, or according to the amplitude decay of a reference structure. EM-BFACTOR is a program that has been designed to widely facilitate the use of the novel method for objective B-factor determination and contrast restoration introduced by Rosenthal and Henderson [Rosenthal, P.B., Henderson, R., 2003. Optimal determination of particle orientation, absolute hand, and contrast loss in single-particle electron cryomicroscopy. J. Mol. Biol. 333, 721-745]. The program has been developed to interact with the most common packages for single particle electron cryomicroscopy. This sharpening method has been further investigated via EM-BFACTOR, concluding that it helps to unravel the high resolution molecular features concealed in experimental density maps, thereby making them better suited for interpretation. Therefore, the method may facilitate the analysis of experimental data in high resolution single particle electron cryomicroscopy.},

	Abstract = {It is becoming routine for cryoEM single particle reconstructions to result in 3D electron density maps with resolutions of approximately 10A, but maps with resolutions of 5A or better are still celebrated events. The electron microscope has a resolving power to better than 2A, and thus should not be a limiting factor; instead the practical limitations in resolution most likely arise from a combination of specimen preparation methods, data collection parameters, and data analysis procedures. With the aid of a highly automated system for acquiring images, coupled to a relational database to keep track of all processing parameters, we have taken a systematic approach to optimizing parameters affecting the resolution of single particle reconstructions. Using GroEL as a test-bed, we performed a series of 3D reconstructions where we systematically varied the number of particles used in computing the map, the accelerating voltage of the microscope, and the electron dose used to acquire the images. We also investigated methods for excluding unacceptable or "bad" particles from contributing to the final 3D map. Using relatively standard instrumentation (Tecnai F20, 4K x 4K CCD, side entry cold stage) and a completely automated approach, these approaches resulted in a map with a nominal resolution of 5.4A (FSC(0.5)) in which secondary structure is clearly discernable and the handedness of some of the alpha-helices in the GroEL structure can be determined.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study addresses the general problem of dividing a density map of a nucleic-acid-protein complex obtained by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) or X-ray crystallography into its two components. When the resolution of the density map approaches approximately 3 A it is generally possible to interpret its shape (i. e., the envelope obtained for a standard choice of threshold) in terms of molecular structure, and assign protein and nucleic acid elements on the basis of their known sequences. The interpretation of low-resolution maps in terms of proteins and nucleic acid elements of known structure is of increasing importance in the study of large macromolecular complexes, but such analyses are difficult.
RESULTS: Here we show that it is possible to separate proteins from nucleic acids in a cryo-EM density map, even at 11.5 A resolution. This is achieved by analysing the (continuous-valued) densities using the difference in scattering density between protein and nucleic acids, the contiguity constraints that the image of any nucleic acid molecule must obey, and the knowledge of the molecular volumes of all proteins.
CONCLUSIONS: The new method, when applied to an 11.5 A cryo-EM map of the Escherichia coli 70S ribosome, reproduces boundary assignments between rRNA and proteins made from higher-resolution X-ray maps of the ribosomal subunits with a high degree of accuracy. Plausible predictions for the positions of as yet unassigned proteins and RNA components are also possible. One of the conclusions derived from this separation is that 23S rRNA is solely responsible for the catalysis of peptide bond formation. Application of the separation method to any nucleoprotein complex appears feasible.},

The computational efficiency of this step is a deciding factor in design of alignment strategies for large sets of noisy data and in development of three-dimensional structure refinement methods. In addition, the accuracy of the alignment method varies depending on the numerical solutions adopted to efficiently perform exhaustive searches for three orientation parameters. The selected alignment methods are analyzed in terms of their computational complexity and the estimates of numbers of arithmetic operations for each method are given. The tests of alignment accuracy are performed using images simulated in accordance with the linear theory of image formation in the electron microscope. It is demonstrated that the efficiency of the alignment methods can be improved if approximate centers of gravity of particle views are known. The accuracy of the methods considered is largely affected, particularly for high noise levels, by the order in which interpolation steps are applied.},

	Abstract = {A three-dimensional (3D) version of the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR)-based resolution measure is introduced. The measure is defined for a class of 3D reconstruction algorithms that use interpolation in Fourier space. The statistical properties of the SSNR are discussed and related to the properties of another resolution measure, the Fourier shell correlation (FSC). The new measure was tested on 3D structures calculated from a simulated set of quasi-evenly spaced 2D projections using a nearest-neighbor interpolation and a gridding algorithm. In the latter case, the results agree very well with the FSC-based estimate, with the exception of very high SSNR values. The main applicability of the 3D SSNR is tomography, where due to the small number of projections collected, FSC cannot be used. The new measure was applied to three sets of tomographic data. It was demonstrated that the measure is sufficiently sensitive to yield theoretically expected results. Therefore, the 3D SSNR opens up the possibility of evaluating the quality of tomographic reconstructions in an objective manner. The 3D distribution of SSNR is of major interest in single-particle analysis. It is shown that the new measure can be used to evaluate the anisotropy of 3D reconstructions. The distribution of SSNR is characterized by three anisotropy indices derived from principal axes of the 3D inertia covariance matrix of the SSNR. These indices are used to construct a 3D Fourier filter which, when applied to a 3D reconstruction of a macromolecule, maximizes the SNR in real space and minimizes real-space artifacts caused by uneven distribution of 2D projections.},

	Abstract = {The current theory of image formation in electron microscopy has been semi-quantitatively successful in describing data. The theory involves parameters due to the transfer function of the microscope (defocus, spherical aberration constant, and amplitude constant ratio) as well as parameters used to describe the background and attenuation of the signal. We present empirical evidence that at least one of the features of this model has not been well characterized. Namely the spectrum of the noise background is not accurately described by a Gaussian and associated "B-factor;" this becomes apparent when one studies high-quality far-from focus data. In order to have both our analysis and conclusions free from any innate bias, we have approached the questions by developing an automated fitting algorithm. The most important features of this routine, not currently found in the literature, are (i). a process for determining the cutoff for those frequencies below which observations and the currently adopted model are not in accord, (ii). a method for determining the resolution at which no more signal is expected to exist, and (iii). a parameter-with units of spatial frequency-that characterizes which frequencies mainly contribute to the signal. Whereas no general relation is seen to exist between either of these two quantities and the defocus, a simple empirical relationship approximately relates all three.},

	Abstract = {Manual selection of single particles in images acquired using cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) will become a significant bottleneck when datasets of a hundred thousand or even a million particles are required for structure determination at near atomic resolution. Algorithm development of fully automated particle selection is thus an important research objective in the cryoEM field. A number of research groups are making promising new advances in this area. Evaluation of algorithms using a standard set of cryoEM images is an essential aspect of this algorithm development. With this goal in mind, a particle selection "bakeoff" was included in the program of the Multidisciplinary Workshop on Automatic Particle Selection for cryoEM. Twelve groups participated by submitting the results of testing their own algorithms on a common dataset. The dataset consisted of 82 defocus pairs of high-magnification micrographs, containing keyhole limpet hemocyanin particles, acquired using cryoEM. The results of the bakeoff are presented in this paper along with a summary of the discussion from the workshop. It was agreed that establishing benchmark particles and using bakeoffs to evaluate algorithms are useful in promoting algorithm development for fully automated particle selection, and that the infrastructure set up to support the bakeoff should be maintained and extended to include larger and more varied datasets, and more criteria for future evaluations.},

	Abstract = {We describe an algorithm for simultaneous refinement of a three-dimensional (3-D) density map and of the orientation parameters of two-dimensional (2-D) projections that are used to reconstruct this map. The application is in electron microscopy, where the 3-D structure of a protein has to be determined from a set of 2-D projections collected at random but initially unknown angles. The design of the algorithm is based on the assumption that initial low resolution approximation of the density map and reasonable guesses for orientation parameters are available. Thus, the algorithm is applicable in final stages of the structure refinement, when the quality of the results is of main concern. We define the objective function to be minimized in real space and solve the resulting nonlinear optimization problem using a Quasi-Newton algorithm. We calculate analytical derivatives with respect to density distribution and the finite difference approximations of derivatives with respect to orientation parameters. We demonstrate that calculation of derivatives is robust with respect to noise in the data. This is due to the fact that noise is annihilated by the back-projection operations. Our algorithm is distinguished from other orientation refinement methods (i) by the simultaneous update of the density map and orientation parameters resulting in a highly efficient computational scheme and (ii) by the high quality of the results produced by a direct minimization of the discrepancy between the 2-D data and the projected views of the reconstructed 3-D structure. We demonstrate the speed and accuracy of our method by using simulated data.},

	Abstract = {The bootstrap-based method for calculation of the 3D variance in cryo-EM maps reconstructed from sets of their projections was applied to a dataset of functional ribosomal complexes containing the Escherichia coli 70S ribosome, tRNAs, and elongation factor G (EF-G). The variance map revealed regions of high variability in the intersubunit space of the ribosome: in the locations of tRNAs, in the putative location of EF-G, and in the vicinity of the L1 protein. This result indicated heterogeneity of the dataset. A method of focused classification was put forward in order to sort out the projection data into approximately homogenous subsets. The method is based on the identification and localization of a region of high variance that a subsequent classification step can be focused on by the use of a 3D spherical mask. After initial classification, template volumes are created and are subsequently refined using a multireference 3D projection alignment procedure. In the application to the ribosome dataset, the two resulting structures were interpreted as resulting from ribosomal complexes with bound EF-G and an empty A site, or, alternatively, from complexes that had no EF-G bound but had both A and P sites occupied by tRNA. The proposed method of focused classification proved to be a successful tool in the analysis of the heterogeneous cryo-EM dataset. The associated calculation of the correlations within the density map confirmed the conformational variability of the complex, which could be interpreted in terms of the ribosomal elongation cycle.},

	Abstract = {In single particle analysis, two-dimensional (2-D) alignment is a fundamental step intended to put into register various particle projections of biological macromolecules collected at the electron microscope. The efficiency and quality of three-dimensional (3-D) structure reconstruction largely depends on the computational speed and alignment accuracy of this crucial step. In order to improve the performance of alignment, we introduce a new method that takes advantage of the highly accurate interpolation scheme based on the gridding method, a version of the nonuniform fast Fourier transform, and utilizes a multi-dimensional optimization algorithm for the refinement of the orientation parameters. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that by using less than half of the sample points and taking twice the runtime, our new 2-D alignment method achieves dramatically better alignment accuracy than that based on quadratic interpolation. We also apply our method to image to volume registration, the key step in the single particle EM structure refinement protocol. We find that in this case the accuracy of the method not only surpasses the accuracy of the commonly used real-space implementation, but results are achieved in much shorter time, making gridding-based alignment a perfect candidate for efficient structure determination in single particle analysis.},

	Abstract = {Macromolecular structure determination by cryo-electron microscopy (EM) and single-particle analysis are based on the assumption that imaged molecules have identical structure. With the increased size of processed data sets, it becomes apparent that many complexes coexist in a mixture of conformational states or contain flexible regions. We describe an implementation of the bootstrap resampling technique that yields estimates of voxel-by-voxel variance of a structure reconstructed from the set of its projections. We introduce a highly efficient reconstruction algorithm that is based on direct Fourier inversion and that incorporates correction for the transfer function of the microscope, thus extending the resolution limits of variance estimation. We also describe a validation method to determine the number of resampled volumes required to achieve stable estimate of the variance. The proposed bootstrap method was applied to a data set of 70S ribosome complexed with tRNA and the elongation factor G. The proposed method of variance estimation opens new possibilities for single-particle analysis, by extending applicability of the technique to heterogeneous data sets of macromolecules and to complexes with significant conformational variability.},

	Abstract = {SET domain protein lysine methyltransferases (PKMT) are a structurally unique class of enzymes that catalyze the specific methylation of lysine residues in a number of different substrates. Especially histone-specific SET domain PKMTs have received widespread attention because of their roles in the regulation of epigenetic gene expression and the development of some cancers. Rubisco large subunit methyltransferase (RLSMT) is a chloroplast-localized SET domain PKMT responsible for the formation of trimethyl-lysine-14 in the large subunit of Rubisco, an essential photosynthetic enzyme. Here, we have used cryoelectron microscopy to produce an 11-A density map of the Rubisco-RLSMT complex. The atomic model of the complex, obtained by fitting crystal structures of Rubisco and RLSMT into the density map, shows that the extensive contact regions between the 2 proteins are mainly mediated by hydrophobic residues and leucine-rich repeats. It further provides insights into potential conformational changes that may occur during substrate binding and catalysis. This study presents the first structural analysis of a SET domain PKMT in complex with its intact polypeptide substrate.},

Therefore, it is now increasingly recognized that sample heterogeneity constitutes a major methodological challenge for cryo-EM. To overcome it dedicated experimental and particularly computational multiparticle approaches have been developed.

	Abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of an object mass density from the set of its 2D line projections lies at a core of both single-particle reconstruction technique and electron tomography. Both techniques utilize electron microscope to collect a set of projections of either multiple objects representing in principle the same macromolecular complex in an isolated form, or a subcellular structure isolated in situ. Therefore, the goal of macromolecular electron microscopy is to invert the projection transformation to recover the distribution of the mass density of the original object. The problem is interesting in that in its discrete form it is ill-posed and not invertible. Various algorithms have been proposed to cope with the practical difficulties of this inversion problem and their differ widely in terms of their robustness with respect to noise in the data, completeness of the collected projection dataset, errors in projections orientation parameters, abilities to efficiently handle large datasets, and other obstacles typically encountered in molecular electron microscopy. Here, we review the theoretical foundations of 3D reconstruction from line projections followed by an overview of reconstruction algorithms routinely used in practice of electron microscopy.},

	Abstract = {Image restoration techniques are used to obtain, given experimental measurements, the best possible approximation of the original object within the limits imposed by instrumental conditions and noise level in the data. In molecular electron microscopy (EM), we are mainly interested in linear methods that preserve the respective relationships between mass densities within the restored map. Here, we describe the methodology of image restoration in structural EM, and more specifically, we will focus on the problem of the optimum recovery of Fourier amplitudes given electron microscope data collected under various defocus settings. We discuss in detail two classes of commonly used linear methods, the first of which consists of methods based on pseudoinverse restoration, and which is further subdivided into mean-square error, chi-square error, and constrained based restorations, where the methods in the latter two subclasses explicitly incorporates non-white distribution of noise in the data. The second class of methods is based on the Wiener filtration approach. We show that the Wiener filter-based methodology can be used to obtain a solution to the problem of amplitude correction (or "sharpening") of the EM map that makes it visually comparable to maps determined by X-ray crystallography, and thus amenable to comparative interpretation. Finally, we present a semiheuristic Wiener filter-based solution to the problem of image restoration given sets of heterogeneous solutions. We conclude the chapter with a discussion of image restoration protocols implemented in commonly used single particle software packages.},

When the amount of detail in the computed density map is low there are no external standards by which the resolution of the result can be judged. Instead, resolution measures in molecular electron microscopy evaluate consistency of the results in reciprocal space and present it as a one-dimensional (1D) function of the modulus of spatial frequency. Here we provide description of standard resolution measures commonly used in electron microscopy. We point out that the organizing principle is the relationship between these measures and the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) of the computed density map. Within this framework it becomes straightforward to describe the connection between the outcome of resolution evaluations and the quality of electron microscopy maps, in particular, the optimum filtration, in the Wiener sense, of the computed map. We also provide a discussion of practical difficulties of evaluation of resolution in electron microscopy, particularly in terms of its sensitivity to data processing operations used during structure determination process in single particle analysis and in electron tomography (ET).},

The method employs PCA of resampled 3D structures computed using subsets of 2D data obtained with a novel hypergeometric sampling scheme. PCA provides us with a small subset of dominating "eigenvolumes" of the system, whose reprojections are compared with experimental projection data to yield their factorial coordinates constructed in a common framework of the 3D space of the macromolecule. Codimensional PCA is unique in the dramatic reduction of dimensionality of the problem, which facilitates rapid determination of both the plausible number of conformers in the sample and their 3D structures. We applied the codimensional PCA to a complex data set of Thermus thermophilus 70S ribosome, and we identified four major conformational states and visualized high mobility of the stalk base region.},

ISAC requires only a small number of simple parameters and, with minimal human intervention, can eliminate bias from two-dimensional image clustering and maximize the quality of group averages that can be used for ab initio three-dimensional structural determination and analysis of macromolecular conformational variability.

In this paper, a method of "angular reconstitution" is described, which allows the a posteriori determination of the relative angular orientations of the projections and thus enables the three-dimensional reconstruction of the object to be calculated. For asymmetric objects, a minimum of three projections is required, which should not be related by a tilt around a single rotation axis. The method can be applied to determine the three-dimensional structure of biological macromolecules based on electron micrographs of randomly oriented individual molecules.

Using cryo-electron microscopy, we have produced a density map of the TfR-Tf complex at subnanometer resolution. An atomic model, obtained by fitting crystal structures of diferric Tf and the receptor ectodomain into the map, shows that the Tf N-lobe is sandwiched between the membrane and the TfR ectodomain and that the C-lobe abuts the receptor helical domain. When Tf binds receptor, its N-lobe moves by about 9 A with respect to its C-lobe.

We have reported expression, purification, and characterization of gp140 (also called gp160e), the soluble, trimeric ectodomain of the SIV envelope glycoprotein, gp160 (B. Chen et al., J. Biol. Chem. 275:34946-34953, 2000). We have now expressed and purified chimeric proteins of SIV gp140 and its variants with the catalytic subunit (C) of Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase). The fusion proteins (SIV gp140-ATC) bind viral receptor CD4 and a number of monoclonal antibodies specific for SIV gp140. The chimeric molecule also has ATCase activity, which requires trimerization of the ATCase C chains. Thus, the fusion protein is trimeric. When ATCase regulatory subunit dimers (R(2)) are added, the fusion protein assembles into dimers of trimers as expected from the structure of C(6)R(6) ATCase. Negative-stain electron microscopy reveals spikey features of both SIV gp140 and SIV gp140-ATC. The production of the fusion proteins may enhance the possibilities for structure determination of the envelope glycoprotein either by electron cryomicroscopy or X-ray crystallography.},

In this paper we illustrate the specific advantages of negative staining, ensuring that this technique will remain an important tool for the study of biological macromolecules. Due to the higher image contrast, much smaller molecules can be visualized by negative staining. Also, while molecules prepared by vitrification usually adopt random orientations in the amorphous ice layer, negative staining tends to induce preferred orientations of the molecules on the carbon support film. Combining negative staining with image classification techniques makes it possible to work with very heterogeneous molecule populations, which are difficult or even impossible to analyze using vitrified specimens.},

We show here that AQP0 from the lens core, containing some carboxy-terminally cleaved AQP0, forms double-layered crystals that recapitulate in vivo junctions. We present the structure of the AQP0 membrane junction as determined by electron crystallography. The junction is formed by three localized interactions between AQP0 molecules in adjoining membranes, mainly mediated by proline residues conserved in AQP0s from different species but not present in most other aquaporins. Whereas all previously determined aquaporin structures show the pore in an open conformation, the water pore is closed in AQP0 junctions. The water pathway in AQP0 also contains an additional pore constriction, not seen in other known aquaporin structures, which may be responsible for pore gating.},

	Abstract = {Aquaporin-0 (AQP0), previously known as major intrinsic protein (MIP), is the only water pore protein expressed in lens fiber cells. AQP0 is highly specific to lens fiber cells and constitutes the most abundant intrinsic membrane protein in these cells. The protein is initially expressed as a full-length protein in young fiber cells in the lens cortex, but becomes increasingly cleaved in the lens core region. Reconstitution of AQP0 isolated from the core of sheep lenses containing a proportion of truncated protein, produced double-layered two-dimensional (2D) crystals, which displayed the same dimensions as the thin 11 nm lens fiber cell junctions, which are prominent in the lens core. In contrast reconstitution of full-length AQP0 isolated from the lens cortex reproducibly yielded single-layered 2D crystals. We present electron diffraction patterns and projection maps of both crystal types. We show that cleavage of the intracellular C terminus enhances the adhesive properties of the extracellular surface of AQP0, indicating a conformational change in the molecule. This change of function of AQP0 from a water pore in the cortex to an adhesion molecule in the lens core constitutes another manifestation of the gene sharing concept originally proposed on the basis of the dual function of crystallins.},

Their modulation is believed to affect learning and memory, and their dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurological and psychiatric diseases. Despite a wealth of functional data, little is known about the intact, three-dimensional structure of these ligand-gated ion channels. Here, we present the structure of native AMPA receptors (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid; AMPA-Rs) purified from rat brain, as determined by single-particle electron microscopy. Unlike the homotetrameric recombinant GluR2 (ref. 3), the native heterotetrameric AMPA-R adopted various conformations, which reflect primarily a variable separation of the two dimeric extracellular amino-terminal domains. Members of the stargazin/TARP family of transmembrane proteins co-purified with AMPA-Rs and contributed to the density representing the transmembrane region of the complex. Glutamate and cyclothiazide markedly altered the conformational equilibrium of the channel complex, suggesting that desensitization is related to separation of the N-terminal domains. These data provide a glimpse of the conformational changes of an important ligand-gated ion channel of the brain.},

	Abstract = {The archaeal ATPase complex PAN, the homolog of the eukaryotic 26S proteasome-regulatory ATPases, was shown to associate transiently with the 20S proteasome upon binding of ATP or ATPgammaS, but not ADP. By electron microscopy (EM), PAN appears as a two-ring structure, capping the 20S, and resembles two densities in the 19S complex. The N termini of the archaeal 20S alpha subunits were found to function as a gate that prevents entry of seven-residue peptides but allows entry of tetrapeptides. Upon association with the 20S particle, PAN stimulates gate opening. Although degradation of globular proteins requires ATP hydrolysis, the PAN-20S complex with ATPgammaS translocates and degrades unfolded and denatured proteins. Rabbit 26S proteasomes also degrade these unfolded proteins upon ATP binding, without hydrolysis. Thus, although unfolding requires energy from ATP hydrolysis, ATP binding alone supports ATPase-20S association, gate opening, and translocation of unfolded substrates into the proteasome, which can occur by facilitated diffusion through the ATPase.},

	Abstract = {Most organisms depend on iron as a co-factor for proteins catalyzing redox reactions. Iron is, however, a difficult element for cells to deal with, as it is insoluble in its ferric (Fe3+) form and potentially toxic in its ferrous (Fe2+) form. Thus, in vertebrates iron is transported through the circulation bound to transferrin (Tf) and delivered to cells through an endocytotic cycle involving the transferrin receptor (TfR). We have previously presented a model for the Tf-TfR complex in its iron-bearing form, the diferric transferrin (dTf)-TfR complex [Cheng, Y., Zak, O., Aisen, P., Harrison, S.C., Walz, T., 2004. Structure of the human transferrin receptor-transferrin complex. Cell 116, 565-576]. We have now calculated a single particle reconstruction for the complex in its iron-free form, the apo-transferrin (apoTf)-TfR complex. The same density map was obtained by aligning raw particle images or class averages of the vitrified apoTf-TfR complex to reference models derived from the structures of the dTf-TfR or apoTf-TfR complex. We were unable to improve the resolution of the apoTf-TfR density map beyond 16A, most likely because of significant structural variability of Tf in its iron-free state. The density map does, however, support the model for the apoTf-TfR we previously proposed based on the dTf-TfR complex structure, and it suggests that receptor-bound apoTf prefers to adopt an open conformation.},

	Abstract = {Most excitatory synaptic transmissions in the central nervous system are mediated by the neurotransmitter glutamate. Binding of glutamate released from the presynaptic membrane causes glutamate receptors in the postsynaptic membrane to open, which results in a transient depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane. The AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) subtype of glutamate receptors is responsible for the majority of excitatory postsynaptic currents and is thought to play a central role in synaptic plasticity. Because modulation of glutamate receptors is believed to be involved in the basic mechanism underlying information storage in the brain, the molecular architecture of native AMPA receptors (AMPA-Rs) is of great interest. Previously, we have shown that AMPA-Rs purified from the brain are tightly associated with members of the stargazin/TARP (transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory protein) family of membrane proteins [Nakagawa et al., Nature 433 (2005), pp. 545-549]. Here, we present a three-dimensional (3D) density map of the hetero-tetrameric AMPA-R without associated stargazin/TARP proteins as determined by cryo-negative stain single-particle electron microscopy. In the absence of stargazin/TARP proteins, the density representing the transmembrane region of the AMPA-R particles is substantially smaller, corroborating our previous analysis that was based solely on projection images.},

Extended integrins exhibited marked flexibility at the alpha subunit genu and between integrin epidermal growth factor-like (I-EGF) domains 1 and 2. A clasp to mimic juxtamembrane association between the integrin alpha and beta subunits stabilized the bent conformation strongly for alpha(X)beta(2) and less so for alpha(L)beta(2). A small molecule allosteric antagonist induced the extended, open headpiece conformation. A Fab known to activate beta(2) integrins on leukocytes induced extension, and a Fab reporter of activation bound only after extension had been induced. The results establish an intimate relationship between extension of beta(2) integrins and their activation in immune responses and leukocyte trafficking.},

Three-dimensional image reconstructions of homogenous populations of in vitro assembled clathrin coats have yielded a molecular model for clathrin and its interactions with some of its partners. The intrinsic averaging required for those calculations has precluded detailed analysis of heterogeneous populations of clathrin-coated vesicles isolated from cells. We have therefore used cryo-electron tomography to study the lattice organization of individual clathrin-coated vesicles and the disposition of the captured vesicle with respect to the surrounding coat. We find a wide range of designs for the clathrin lattice, with different patterns of pentagonal, hexagonal, and occasionally heptagonal facets. Many coats, even smaller ones, enclose membrane vesicles, which are generally offset from the center of the clathrin shell. The electron density distribution between the coat and the underlying vesicle is not uniform, and the number of apparent contacts that anchor the clathrin lattice to the vesicle membrane is significantly less than the number of clathrin heavy chains in the assembly. We suggest that the eccentric position of the vesicle reflects the polarity of assembly, from initiation of coat formation to membrane pinching.},

	Abstract = {Substrates enter the cylindrical 20S proteasome through a gated channel that is regulated by the ATPases in the 19S regulatory particle in eukaryotes or the homologous PAN ATPase complex in archaea. These ATPases contain a conserved C-terminal hydrophobic-tyrosine-X (HbYX) motif that triggers gate opening upon ATP binding. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we identified the sites in the archaeal 20S where PAN's C-terminal residues bind and determined the structures of the gate in its closed and open forms. Peptides containing the HbYX motif bind to 20S in the pockets between neighboring alpha subunits where they interact with conserved residues required for gate opening. This interaction induces a rotation in the alpha subunits and displacement of a reverse-turn loop that stabilizes the open-gate conformation. This mechanism differs from that of PA26/28, which lacks the HbYX motif and does not cause alpha subunit rotation. These findings demonstrated how the ATPases' C termini function to facilitate substrate entry.},

	Abstract = {Single-particle electron microscopy (EM) can provide structural information for a large variety of biological molecules, ranging from small proteins to large macromolecular assemblies, without the need to produce crystals. The year 2008 has become a landmark year for single-particle EM as for the first time density maps have been produced at a resolution that made it possible to trace protein backbones or even to build atomic models. In this review, we highlight some of the recent successes achieved by single-particle EM and describe the individual steps involved in producing a density map by this technique. We also discuss some of the remaining challenges and areas, in which further advances would have a great impact on the results that can be achieved by single-particle EM.},

	Abstract = {We evaluated imaging plates (IPs) and the DITABIS Micron scanner for their use in recording images of negatively stained single-particle specimens and electron diffraction patterns of two-dimensional crystals. We first established the optimal imaging and read-out conditions for images of negatively stained single-particle specimens using the signal-to-noise ratio of the images as the evaluation criterion. We found that images were best recorded on IPs at a magnification of 67,000x, read out with a gain setting of 20,000 and a laser power setting of 30% with subsequent binning over 2 x 2 pixels. Our results show that for images of negatively stained specimens, for which the resolution is limited to approximately 20 A, IPs are a good alternative to EM film. We also compared IPs with a 2K x 2K Gatan charge-coupled device (CCD) camera for their use in recording electron diffraction patterns of sugar-embedded two-dimensional crystals. Diffraction patterns of aquaporin-0 recorded on IPs and with the CCD camera showed reflections beyond 3 A and had similar R(Friedel) as well as R(merge) values. IPs can thus be used to collect diffraction patterns, but CCD cameras are more convenient and remain the best option for recording electron diffraction patterns.},

It is also found in the serum of infected individuals (Caby MP, Lankar D, Vincendeau-Scherrer C, Raposo G, Bonnerot C. Exosomal-like vesicles are present in human blood plasma. Int Immunol 2005;17:879-887). Extracellular Nef protein has deleterious effects on CD4(+) T cells (James CO, Huang MB, Khan M, Garcia-Barrio M, Powell MD, Bond VC. Extracellular Nef protein targets CD4(+) T cells for apoptosis by interacting with CXCR4 surface receptors. J Virol 2004;78:3099-3109), the primary targets of HIV, and can suppress immunoglobulin class switching in bystander B cells (Qiao X, He B, Chiu A, Knowles DM, Chadburn A, Cerutti A. Human immunodeficiency virus 1 Nef suppresses CD40-dependent immunoglobulin class switching in bystander B cells. Nat Immunol 2006;7:302-310). Nevertheless, the mode of exit of Nef from infected cells remains a conundrum. We found that Nef stimulates its own export via the release of exosomes from all cells examined. Depending on its intracellular location, these Nef exosomes form at the plasma membrane, late endosomes or both compartments in Jurkat, SupT1 and primary T cells, respectively. Nef release through exosomes is conserved also during HIV-1 infection of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). Released Nef exosomes cause activation-induced cell death of resting PBLs in vitro. Thus, HIV-infected cells export Nef in bioactive vesicles, which facilitate the depletion of CD4(+) T cells that is a hallmark of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).},

	Abstract = {Protein degradation in the 20S proteasome is regulated in eukaryotes by the 19S ATPase complex and in archaea by the homologous PAN ATPase ring complex. Subunits of these hexameric ATPases contain on their C-termini a conserved hydrophobic-tyrosine-X (HbYX) motif that docks into pockets in the 20S to stimulate the opening of a gated substrate entry channel. Here, we report the crystal structure of the archaeal 20S proteasome in complex with the C-terminus of the archaeal proteasome regulatory ATPase, PAN. This structure defines the detailed interactions between the critical C-terminal HbYX motif and the 20S alpha-subunits and indicates that the intersubunit pocket in the 20S undergoes an induced-fit conformational change on binding of the HbYX motif. This structure together with related mutagenesis data suggest how in eukaryotes certain proteasomal ATPases bind to specific pockets in an asymmetrical manner to regulate gate opening.},

	Abstract = {Evenly spaced nucleosomes directly correlate with condensed chromatin and gene silencing. The ATP-dependent chromatin assembly factor (ACF) forms such structures in vitro and is required for silencing in vivo. ACF generates and maintains nucleosome spacing by constantly moving a nucleosome towards the longer flanking DNA faster than the shorter flanking DNA. How the enzyme rapidly moves back and forth between both sides of a nucleosome to accomplish bidirectional movement is unknown. Here we show that nucleosome movement depends cooperatively on two ACF molecules, indicating that ACF functions as a dimer of ATPases. Further, the nucleotide state determines whether the dimer closely engages one or both sides of the nucleosome. Three-dimensional reconstruction by single-particle electron microscopy of the ATPase-nucleosome complex in an activated ATP state reveals a dimer architecture in which the two ATPases face each other. Our results indicate a model in which the two ATPases work in a coordinated manner, taking turns to engage either side of a nucleosome, thereby allowing processive bidirectional movement. This novel dimeric motor mechanism differs from that of dimeric motors such as kinesin and dimeric helicases that processively translocate unidirectionally and reflects the unique challenges faced by motors that move nucleosomes.},

	Abstract = {The highly organized microstructure of dental enamel is a result of protein-guided anisotropic growth of apatite nanofibers. It is established that amelogenin proteins, the main constituent of the developing enamel matrix, form nanospheres in vitro, but the amphiphilic nature of the full-length protein conveys the possibility of generating more complex structures as observed with other surfactant-like molecules. This study tested if the use of metastable oil-water emulsions can induce supramolecular assemblies of amelogenin. Recombinant full-length amelogenin, rH174, was mixed into octanol/ethyl acetate preparations of different ratios to form emulsions at pH 4.5 and 7.4. Atomic force and electron microscopy showed the formation of 16.7$\pm$1.0nm wide nanoribbons which grew to several micrometer length over a period of days. Nanoribbons formed from reverse micelles by enabling hydrophobic tails of the molecules to interact while preventing the formation of amelogenin nanospheres. Ribbon formation required the presence of calcium and phosphate ions and may be localized at a dark central line along the amelogenin ribbons. The ribbons have a strong tendency to align in parallel maintaining 5-20nm space between each other. The growth rates and number of ribbons were significantly higher at pH 4.5 and related to the metastability of the emulsion. A model for ribbon extension proposes the addition of short segments or amelogenin dimers to the ends of the ribbon. The formation of self-aligning and uniaxially elongating amelogenin structures triggered by the presence of calcium and phosphate may represent a suitable new model for protein controlled mineralization in enamel.},

	Abstract = {Full resolution electron microscopic tomographic (EMT) reconstruction of large-scale tilt series requires significant computing power. The desire to perform multiple cycles of iterative reconstruction and realignment dramatically increases the pressing need to improve reconstruction performance. This has motivated us to develop a distributed multi-GPU (graphics processing unit) system to provide the required computing power for rapid constrained, iterative reconstructions of very large three-dimensional (3D) volumes. The participating GPUs reconstruct segments of the volume in parallel, and subsequently, the segments are assembled to form the complete 3D volume. Owing to its power and versatility, the CUDA (NVIDIA, USA) platform was selected for GPU implementation of the EMT reconstruction. For a system containing 10 GPUs provided by 5 GTX295 cards, 10 cycles of SIRT reconstruction for a tomogram of 4096(2) × 512 voxels from an input tilt series containing 122 projection images of 4096(2) pixels (single precision float) takes a total of 1845 s of which 1032 s are for computation with the remainder being the system overhead. The same system takes only 39 s total to reconstruct 1024(2) × 256 voxels from 122 1024(2) pixel projections. While the system overhead is non-trivial, performance analysis indicates that adding extra GPUs to the system would lead to steadily enhanced overall performance. Therefore, this system can be easily expanded to generate superior computing power for very large tomographic reconstructions and especially to empower iterative cycles of reconstruction and realignment.},

	Abstract = {Single particle electron microscopy (EM), of both negative stained or frozen hydrated biological samples, has become a versatile tool in structural biology. In recent years, this method has achieved great success in studying structures of proteins and macromolecular complexes. Compared with electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM), in which frozen hydrated protein samples are embedded in a thin layer of vitreous ice, negative staining is a simpler sample preparation method in which protein samples are embedded in a thin layer of dried heavy metal salt to increase specimen contrast. The enhanced contrast of negative stain EM allows examination of relatively small biological samples. In addition to determining three-dimensional (3D) structure of purified proteins or protein complexes, this method can be used for much broader purposes. For example, negative stain EM can be easily used to visualize purified protein samples, obtaining information such as homogeneity/heterogeneity of the sample, formation of protein complexes or large assemblies, or simply to evaluate the quality of a protein preparation. In this video article, we present a complete protocol for using an EM to observe negatively stained protein sample, from preparing carbon coated grids for negative stain EM to acquiring images of negatively stained sample in an electron microscope operated at 120kV accelerating voltage. These protocols have been used in our laboratory routinely and can be easily followed by novice users.},

	Abstract = {Self-assembly of amelogenin plays a key role in controlling enamel biomineralization. Recently, we generated self-aligning nanoribbons of amelogenin in water-in-oil emulsions stabilized by the full-length protein (rH174). Here, we tested the hypothesis that the hydrophilic C-terminus is critical for self-assembly of amelogenin into nanoribbons. The self-assembled structures of two amelogenin cleavage products, rH163 and rH146, were compared with structures of rH174 at different pH values and degrees of saturation using atomic force microscopy, electron microscopy, and dynamic light scattering. We observed that the number density of rH174 nanoribbons increased significantly when the initial pH was raised from 4.5 to 5.6. Nanoribbons, as well as unique helical nanostructures, were also readily observed when amelogenin rH146 was used, but showed little tendency for parallel alignment and did not bundle into fibrils like rH174. In contrast, rH163 rarely formed nanoribbons but predominantly assembled into nanospheres under the same conditions. We conclude that the presence of a hydrophilic C-terminus may not be a prerequisite for nanoribbon formation but may be critical for ribbon alignment and subsequent fibril formation. These results highlight the contribution of the hydrophobic domain in the self-assembly of elongated structures of amelogenins. Molecular mechanisms governing these processes based on the formation of reverse micelles are discussed.},

One fundamental limitation is that images of small proteins embedded in vitreous ice do not contain adequate features for accurate image alignment. We describe a general strategy to overcome this limitation by selecting a fragment antigen binding (Fab) to form a stable and rigid complex with a target protein, thus providing a defined feature for accurate image alignment. Using this approach, we determined a three-dimensional structure of an ∼65 kDa protein by single particle cryoEM. Because Fabs can be readily generated against a wide range of proteins by phage display, this approach is generally applicable to study many small proteins by single particle cryoEM.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Structural characterization of protein interactions is necessary for understanding and modulating biological processes. On one hand, X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy provide atomic resolution structures but the data collection process is typically long and the success rate is low. On the other hand, computational methods for modeling assembly structures from individual components frequently suffer from high false-positive rate, rarely resulting in a unique solution.
RESULTS: Here, we present a combined approach that computationally integrates data from a variety of fast and accessible experimental techniques for rapid and accurate structure determination of protein-protein complexes. The integrative method uses atomistic models of two interacting proteins and one or more datasets from five accessible experimental techniques: a small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) profile, 2D class average images from negative-stain electron microscopy micrographs (EM), a 3D density map from single-particle negative-stain EM, residue type content of the protein-protein interface from NMR spectroscopy and chemical cross-linking detected by mass spectrometry. The method is tested on a docking benchmark consisting of 176 known complex structures and simulated experimental data. The near-native model is the top scoring one for up to 61% of benchmark cases depending on the included experimental datasets; in comparison to 10% for standard computational docking. We also collected SAXS, 2D class average images and 3D density map from negative-stain EM to model the PCSK9 antigen-J16 Fab antibody complex, followed by validation of the model by a subsequently available X-ray crystallographic structure.},

@article{Martinez-Avila:2012aa,
	Abstract = {Enamel matrix self-assembly has long been suggested as the driving force behind aligned nanofibrous hydroxyapatite formation. We tested if amelogenin, the main enamel matrix protein, can self-assemble into ribbon-like structures in physiologic solutions. Ribbons 17 nm wide were observed to grow several micrometers in length, requiring calcium, phosphate, and pH 4.0-6.0. The pH range suggests that the formation of ion bridges through protonated histidine residues is essential to self-assembly, supported by a statistical analysis of 212 phosphate-binding proteins predicting 12 phosphate-binding histidines. Thermophoretic analysis verified the importance of calcium and phosphate in self-assembly. X-ray scattering characterized amelogenin dimers with dimensions fitting the cross-section of the amelogenin ribbon, leading to the hypothesis that antiparallel dimers are the building blocks of the ribbons. Over 5-7 days, ribbons self-organized into bundles composed of aligned ribbons mimicking the structure of enamel crystallites in enamel rods. These observations confirm reports of filamentous organic components in developing enamel and provide a new model for matrix-templated enamel mineralization.},

@article{Canzio:2013aa,
	Abstract = {A hallmark of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9)-methylated heterochromatin, conserved from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe to humans, is its ability to spread to adjacent genomic regions. Central to heterochromatin spread is heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), which recognizes H3K9-methylated chromatin, oligomerizes and forms a versatile platform that participates in diverse nuclear functions, ranging from gene silencing to chromosome segregation. How HP1 proteins assemble on methylated nucleosomal templates and how the HP1-nucleosome complex achieves functional versatility remain poorly understood. Here we show that binding of the key S. pombe HP1 protein, Swi6, to methylated nucleosomes drives a switch from an auto-inhibited state to a spreading-competent state. In the auto-inhibited state, a histone-mimic sequence in one Swi6 monomer blocks methyl-mark recognition by the chromodomain of another monomer. Auto-inhibition is relieved by recognition of two template features, the H3K9 methyl mark and nucleosomal DNA. Cryo-electron-microscopy-based reconstruction of the Swi6-nucleosome complex provides the overall architecture of the spreading-competent state in which two unbound chromodomain sticky ends appear exposed. Disruption of the switch between the auto-inhibited and spreading-competent states disrupts heterochromatin assembly and gene silencing in vivo. These findings are reminiscent of other conditionally activated polymerization processes, such as actin nucleation, and open up a new class of regulatory mechanisms that operate on chromatin in vivo.},

	Abstract = {The proteasomal ATPase ring, comprising Rpt1-Rpt6, associates with the heptameric α-ring of the proteasome core particle (CP) in the mature proteasome, with the Rpt carboxy-terminal tails inserting into pockets of the α-ring. Rpt ring assembly is mediated by four chaperones, each binding a distinct Rpt subunit. Here we report that the base subassembly of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteasome, which includes the Rpt ring, forms a high-affinity complex with the CP. This complex is subject to active dissociation by the chaperones Hsm3, Nas6 and Rpn14. Chaperone-mediated dissociation was abrogated by a non-hydrolysable ATP analogue, indicating that chaperone action is coupled to nucleotide hydrolysis by the Rpt ring. Unexpectedly, synthetic Rpt tail peptides bound α-pockets with poor specificity, except for Rpt6, which uniquely bound the α2/α3-pocket. Although the Rpt6 tail is not visualized within an α-pocket in mature proteasomes, it inserts into the α2/α3-pocket in the base-CP complex and is important for complex formation. Thus, the Rpt-CP interface is reconfigured when the lid complex joins the nascent proteasome to form the mature holoenzyme.},

	Abstract = {In recent work with large high-symmetry viruses, single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) has achieved the determination of near-atomic-resolution structures by allowing direct fitting of atomic models into experimental density maps. However, achieving this goal with smaller particles of lower symmetry remains challenging. Using a newly developed single electron-counting detector, we confirmed that electron beam-induced motion substantially degrades resolution, and we showed that the combination of rapid readout and nearly noiseless electron counting allow image blurring to be corrected to subpixel accuracy, restoring intrinsic image information to high resolution (Thon rings visible to ∼3 {\AA}). Using this approach, we determined a 3.3-{\AA}-resolution structure of an ∼700-kDa protein with D7 symmetry, the Thermoplasma acidophilum 20S proteasome, showing clear side-chain density. Our method greatly enhances image quality and data acquisition efficiency-key bottlenecks in applying near-atomic-resolution cryo-EM to a broad range of protein samples.},

	Abstract = {A recent technological breakthrough in electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) is the development of direct electron detection cameras for data acquisition. By bypassing the traditional phosphor scintillator and fiber optic coupling, these cameras have greatly enhanced sensitivity and detective quantum efficiency (DQE). Of the three currently available commercial cameras, the Gatan K2 Summit was designed specifically for counting individual electron events. Counting further enhances the DQE, allows for practical doubling of detector resolution and eliminates noise arising from the variable deposition of energy by each primary electron. While counting has many advantages, undercounting of electrons happens when more than one electron strikes the same area of the detector within the analog readout period (coincidence loss), which influences image quality. In this work, we characterized the K2 Summit in electron counting mode, and studied the relationship of dose rate and coincidence loss and its influence on the quality of counted images. We found that coincidence loss reduces low frequency amplitudes but has no significant influence on the signal-to-noise ratio of the recorded image. It also has little influence on high frequency signals. Images of frozen hydrated archaeal 20S proteasome (~700 kDa, D7 symmetry) recorded at the optimal dose rate retained both high-resolution signal and low-resolution contrast and enabled calculating a 3.6 {\AA} three-dimensional reconstruction from only 10,000 particles.},

Here we exploit advances in electron cryo-microscopy to determine the structure of a mammalian TRP channel, TRPV1, at 3.4 {\AA} resolution, breaking the side-chain resolution barrier for membrane proteins without crystallization. Like voltage-gated channels, TRPV1 exhibits four-fold symmetry around a central ion pathway formed by transmembrane segments 5-6 (S5-S6) and the intervening pore loop, which is flanked by S1-S4 voltage-sensor-like domains. TRPV1 has a wide extracellular 'mouth' with a short selectivity filter. The conserved 'TRP domain' interacts with the S4-S5 linker, consistent with its contribution to allosteric modulation. Subunit organization is facilitated by interactions among cytoplasmic domains, including amino-terminal ankyrin repeats. These observations provide a structural blueprint for understanding unique aspects of TRP channel function.},

	Abstract = {ClC-type Cl- channels, as two-pore homodimers, display an architecture unprecedented in selective ion channels, yet little is known regarding their mechanisms of selectivity and gating. In contrast to the great successes with K+ channels, a decade of mutagenic analysis has revealed little about the structure and function of the ClCs: even the number of ion-conducting pores per complex is controversial. Thus, for these proteins direct structural information is particularly important. We have formed two-dimensional crystals of a bacterial CIC homologue, and are analysing their structure using cryo-electron microscopy of glucose-embedded specimens. Here we report the measurement of electron diffraction patterns from these crystals. Unfettered by the imaging limitations of the electron microscope, the diffraction patterns reveal ordering of the crystals to at least 3.8 A resolution, suggesting that they can be used to generate an atomic model of the protein. We present an improved projection structure of the channel at 6.5 A using amplitude data derived from four electron diffraction patterns, with crystallographic statistics comparable to those reported for other high-quality two-dimensional crystals.},

	Abstract = {Accurate knowledge of defocus and tilt parameters is essential for the determination of three-dimensional protein structures at high resolution using electron microscopy. We present two computer programs, CTFFIND3 and CTFTILT, which determine defocus parameters from images of untilted specimens, as well as defocus and tilt parameters from images of tilted specimens, respectively. Both programs use a simple algorithm that fits the amplitude modulations visible in a power spectrum with a calculated contrast transfer function (CTF). The background present in the power spectrum is calculated using a low-pass filter. The background is then subtracted from the original power spectrum, allowing the fitting of only the oscillatory component of the CTF. CTFTILT determines specimen tilt parameters by measuring the defocus at a series of locations on the image while constraining them to a single plane. We tested the algorithm on images of two-dimensional crystals by comparing the results with those obtained using crystallographic methods. The images also contained contrast from carbon support film that added to the visibility of the CTF oscillations. The tests suggest that the fitting procedure is able to determine the image defocus with an error of about 10nm, whereas tilt axis and tilt angle are determined with an error of about 2 degrees and 1 degrees, respectively. Further tests were performed on images of single protein particles embedded in ice that were recorded from untilted or slightly tilted specimens. The visibility of the CTF oscillations from these images was reduced due to the lack of a carbon support film. Nevertheless, the test results suggest that the fitting procedure is able to determine image defocus and tilt angle with errors of about 100 nm and 6 degrees, respectively.},

The structure shows a single channel complex with an approximate total molecular mass of 550 kDa, corresponding to the five known subunits of the DHPR, and bound detergent and lipid. Features visible in our structure together with antibody labeling of the beta and alpha(2) subunits allowed us to assign locations for four of the five subunits within the structure. The most striking feature of the structure is the extra-cellular alpha(2) subunit that protrudes from the membrane domain in close proximity to the alpha(1) subunit. The cytosolic beta subunit is located close to the membrane and adjacent to subunits alpha(1), gamma and delta.

We also expressed and purified both WT and Delta C Shaker, assembled with the rat KvBeta2-subunit. By using a difference map between the full-length and truncated Shaker alpha-beta complexes, a conformational change was identified that shifts a large part of the C terminus away from the membrane domain and into close contact with the Beta-subunit.

	Abstract = {A real-space structure refinement method, originally developed for macromolecular X-ray crystallography, has been applied to protein structure analysis by electron microscopy (EM). This method simultaneously optimizes the fit of an atomic model to a density map and the stereo-chemical properties of the model by minimizing an energy function. The performance of this method is characterized at different resolution and signal-to-noise ratio conditions typical for EM electron density maps. A multi-resolution scheme is devised to improve the convergence of the refinement on the global energy minimum. Applications of the method to various model systems are demonstrated here. The first case is the arrangement of FlgE molecules in the helical filament of flagellar hook, in which refinement with segmented rigid bodies improves the density correlation and reduces severe van der Waals contacts among the symmetry-related subunits. The second case is a conformational analysis of the NSF AAA ATPase in which a multi-conformer model is used in the refinement to investigate the arrangement of the two ATPase domains in the molecule. The third case is a docking simulation in which the crystal structure of actin and the NOE data from NMR experiments on the dematin headpiece are combined with a low-resolution EM density map to generate an atomic model of the F-actin-dematin headpiece structure.},

	Abstract = {The spliceosome is a multimegadalton RNA-protein machine that removes noncoding sequences from nascent pre-mRNAs. Recruitment of the spliceosome to splice sites and subsequent splicing require a series of dynamic interactions among the spliceosome's component U snRNPs and many additional protein factors. These dynamics present several challenges for structural analyses, including purification of stable complexes to compositional homogeneity and assessment of conformational heterogeneity. We have isolated spliceosomes arrested before the second chemical step of splicing (C complex) in which U2, U5 and U6 snRNAs are stably associated. Using electron microscopy, we obtained images of C complex spliceosomes under cryogenic conditions and determined a three-dimensional structure of a core complex to a resolution of 30 A. The structure reveals a particle of dimensions 27 x 22 x 24 nm with a relatively open arrangement of three primary domains.},

	Abstract = {Clathrin-coated vesicles are important vehicles of membrane traffic in cells. We report the structure of a clathrin lattice at subnanometre resolution, obtained from electron cryomicroscopy of coats assembled in vitro. We trace most of the 1,675-residue clathrin heavy chain by fitting known crystal structures of two segments, and homology models of the rest, into the electron microscopy density map. We also define the position of the central helical segment of the light chain. A helical tripod, the carboxy-terminal parts of three heavy chains, projects inward from the vertex of each three-legged clathrin triskelion, linking that vertex to 'ankles' of triskelions centred two vertices away. Analysis of coats with distinct diameters shows an invariant pattern of contacts in the neighbourhood of each vertex, with more variable interactions along the extended parts of the triskelion 'legs'. These invariant local interactions appear to stabilize the lattice, allowing assembly and uncoating to be controlled by events at a few specific sites.},

	Abstract = {Clathrin-coated pits invaginate from specific membrane compartments and pinch off as coated vesicles. These vesicles then uncoat rapidly once released. The Hsc70 molecular chaperone effects the uncoating reaction, and is guided to appropriate locations on clathrin lattices by the J-domain-containing co-chaperone molecule auxilin. This raises the question of how a local event such as ATP hydrolysis by Hsc70 can catalyse a global disassembly. Here, we have used electron cryomicroscopy to determine 12-A-resolution structures of in-vitro-assembled clathrin coats in association with a carboxy-terminal fragment of auxilin that contains both the clathrin-binding region and the J domain. We have located the auxilin fragment by computing differences between these structures and those lacking auxilin (described in an accompanying paper). Auxilin binds within the clathrin lattice near contacts between an inward-projecting C-terminal helical tripod and the crossing of two 'ankle' segments; it also contacts the terminal domain of yet another clathrin 'leg'. It therefore recruits Hsc70 to the neighbourhood of a set of critical interactions. Auxilin binding produces a local change in heavy-chain contacts, creating a detectable global distortion of the clathrin coat. We propose a mechanism by which local destabilization of the lattice promotes general uncoating.},

	Abstract = {One of the main goals in the determination of three-dimensional macromolecular structures from electron microscope images of individual molecules and complexes (single particles) is a sufficiently high spatial resolution, about 4 A, at which the interpretation with an atomic model becomes possible. To reach high resolution, an iterative refinement procedure using an expectation maximization algorithm is often used that leads to a more accurate alignment of the positional and orientational parameters for each particle. We show here the results of refinement algorithms that use a phase residual, a linear correlation coefficient, or a weighted correlation coefficient to align individual particles. The algorithms were applied to computer-generated data sets that contained projections from model structures, as well as noise. The algorithms show different degrees of over-fitting, especially at high resolution where the signal is weak. We demonstrate that the degree of over-fitting is reduced with a weighting scheme that depends on the signal-to-noise ratio in the data. The weighting also improves the accuracy of resolution measurement by the commonly used Fourier shell correlation. The performance of the refinement algorithms is compared to that using a maximum likelihood approach. The weighted correlation coefficient was implemented in the computer program FREALIGN.},

However, in the crystal structure of the inactive complex, they are too far apart to form such a nucleus. Here, we show using EM that yeast and bovine Arp2/3 complexes exist in a distribution among open, intermediate and closed conformations. The crystal structure docks well into the open conformation. The activator WASp binds at the cleft between Arp2 and Arp3, and all WASp-bound complexes are closed. The inhibitor coronin binds near the p35 subunit, and all coronin-bound complexes are open. Activating and loss-of-function mutations in the p35 subunit skew conformational distribution in opposite directions, closed and open, respectively. We conclude that WASp stabilizes p35-dependent closure of the complex, holding Arp2 and Arp3 closer together to nucleate an actin filament.},

We have used the well-characterized structure of the transferrin (Tf)-transferrin receptor (TfR) complex to study how specimen preparation techniques influence the outcome of single particle EM reconstructions. The Tf-TfR complex is small (290kDa) and of low symmetry (2-fold). Angular reconstitution from images of vitrified specimens does not reliably converge on the correct structure. Random conical tilt reconstructions from negatively stained specimens are reliable, but show variable degrees of artifacts depending on the negative staining protocol. Alignment of class averages from vitrified specimens to a 3D negative stain reference model using FREALIGN largely eliminated artifacts in the resulting 3D maps, but not completely. Our results stress the need for critical evaluation of structures determined by single particle EM.},

At the core of the EJC are four proteins: eIF4AIII, a member of the DExH/D-box family of NTP-dependent RNA binding proteins, Y14, Magoh, and MLN51. These proteins form a stable heterotetramer that remains bound to the mRNA throughout many different cellular environments. We have determined the three-dimensional (3D) structure of this EJC core using negative-stain random-conical tilt electron microscopy. This structure represents the first structure of a DExH/D-box protein in complex with its binding partners. The EJC core is a four-lobed complex with a central channel and dimensions consistent with its known RNA footprint of about ten nucleotides. Using known X-ray crystallographic structures and a model of three of the four components, we propose a model for complex assembly on RNA and explain how Y14:Magoh may influence eIF4AIII's RNA binding.},

We find that the analysed fibril is discernibly polar and represents a left-handed helix consisting of two or three protofilaments. These are organised in a manner so that the cross-section is, under the present resolution conditions (2.6 nm), S-shaped. In the cross-section, each protofilament can accommodate two beta-strands, suggesting that each protofilament contains two cross-beta-sheets.

	Abstract = {The treatment of helical objects as a string of single particles has become an established technique to resolve their three-dimensional (3D) structure using electron cryo-microscopy. It can be applied to a wide range of helical particles such as viruses, microtubules and helical filaments. We have made improvements to this approach using Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) as a test specimen and obtained a map from 210,000 asymmetric units at a resolution better than 5 A. This was made possible by performing a full correction of the contrast transfer function of the microscope. Alignment of helical segments was helped by constraints derived from the helical symmetry of the virus. Furthermore, symmetrization was implemented by multiple inclusions of symmetry-related views in the 3D reconstruction. We used the density map to build an atomic model of TMV. The model was refined using a real-space refinement strategy that accommodates multiple conformers. The atomic model shows significant deviations from the deposited model for the helical form of TMV at the lower-radius region (residues 88 to 109). This region appears more ordered with well-defined secondary structure, compared with the earlier helical structure. The RNA phosphate backbone is sandwiched between two arginine side-chains, stabilizing the interaction between RNA and coat protein. A cluster of two or three carboxylates is buried in a hydrophobic environment isolating it from neighboring subunits. These carboxylates may represent the so-called Caspar carboxylates that form a metastable switch for viral disassembly. Overall, the observed differences suggest that the new model represents a different, more stable state of the virus, compared with the earlier published model.},

	Abstract = {Maximum likelihood (ML) processing of transmission electron microscopy images of protein particles can produce reconstructions of superior resolution due to a reduced reference bias. We have investigated a ML processing approach to images centered on the unit cells of two-dimensional (2D) crystal images. The implemented software makes use of the predictive lattice node tracking in the MRC software, which is used to window particle stacks. These are then noise-whitened and subjected to ML processing. Resulting ML maps are translated into amplitudes and phases for further processing within the 2dx software package. Compared with ML processing for randomly oriented single particles, the required computational costs are greatly reduced as the 2D crystals restrict the parameter search space. The software was applied to images of negatively stained or frozen hydrated 2D crystals of different crystal order. We find that the ML algorithm is not free from reference bias, even though its sensitivity to noise correlation is lower than for pure cross-correlation alignment. Compared with crystallographic processing, the newly developed software yields better resolution for 2D crystal images of lower crystal quality, and it performs equally well for well-ordered crystal images.},

	Abstract = {Electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) yields images of macromolecular assemblies and their components, from which 3D structures can be determined, by using an image processing method commonly known as "single-particle reconstruction." During the past two decades, this technique has become an important tool for 3D structure determination, but it generally has not been possible to determine atomic models. In principle, individual molecular images contain high-resolution information contaminated by a much higher level of noise. In practice, it has been unclear whether current averaging methods are adequate to extract this information from the background. We present here a reconstruction, obtained by using recently developed image processing methods, of the rotavirus inner capsid particle ("double-layer particle" or DLP) at a resolution suitable for interpretation by an atomic model. The result establishes single-particle reconstruction as a high-resolution technique. We show by direct comparison that the cryo-EM reconstruction of viral protein 6 (VP6) of the rotavirus DLP is similar in clarity to a 3.8-A resolution map obtained from x-ray crystallography. At this resolution, most of the amino acid side chains produce recognizable density. The icosahedral symmetry of the particle was an important factor in achieving this resolution in the cryo-EM analysis, but as the size of recordable datasets increases, single-particle reconstruction also is likely to yield structures at comparable resolution from samples of much lower symmetry. This potential has broad implications for structural cell biology.},

Despite their prevalence in Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases, important details of the structure of amyloid fibrils remain unknown. Here, we present a three-dimensional structure of a mature amyloid fibril formed by Abeta(1-40) peptide, determined by electron cryomicroscopy at approximately 8-A resolution. The fibril consists of two protofilaments, each containing approximately 5-nm-long regions of beta-sheet structure. A local twofold symmetry within each region suggests that pairs of beta-sheets are formed from equivalent parts of two Abeta(1-40) peptides contained in each protofilament. The pairing occurs via tightly packed interfaces, reminiscent of recently reported steric zipper structures. However, unlike these previous structures, the beta-sheet pairing is observed within an amyloid fibril and includes significantly longer amino acid sequences.},

Alzheimer's amyloid fibrils consist of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide and occur in a range of structurally different fibril morphologies. The structural characteristics of 12 single Abeta(1-40) amyloid fibrils, all formed under the same solution conditions, were determined by electron cryo-microscopy and three-dimensional reconstruction. The majority of analyzed fibrils form a range of morphologies that show almost continuously altering structural properties. The observed fibril polymorphism implies that amyloid formation can lead, for the same polypeptide sequence, to many different patterns of inter- or intra-residue interactions. This property differs significantly from native, monomeric protein folding reactions that produce, for one protein sequence, only one ordered conformation and only one set of inter-residue interactions.},

First, the structure reveals assemblies of five subunits while tetramers were anticipated; pentameric stoichiometry is observed also in solution by scanning transmission electron microscopy mass analysis and analytical ultracentrifugation. Second, the same BTB (bric-a-brac, tramtrack, broad complex) domain surface mediates the assembly of five KCTD5 and four voltage-gated K(+) (Kv) channel subunits; four amino acid differences appear crucial. Third, KCTD5 complexes have well-defined N- and C-terminal modules separated by a flexible linker that swivels by approximately 30 degrees; the C-module shows a new fold and is required to bind Golgi reassembly stacking protein 55 with approximately 1 microM affinity, as judged by surface plasmon resonance and ultracentrifugation. Fourth, despite the homology reflected in its name, KCTD5 does not impact the operation of Kv4.2, Kv3.4, Kv2.1, or Kv1.2 channels.},

We have traced the VP7 polypeptide chain, including parts not seen in its X-ray crystal structure. The 3 well-ordered, 30-residue, N-terminal "arms" of each VP7 trimer grip the underlying trimer of VP6, an inner-capsid protein.

	Abstract = {The chaperone Hsc70 drives the clathrin assembly-disassembly cycle forward by stimulating dissociation of a clathrin lattice. A J-domain containing co-chaperone, auxilin, associates with a freshly budded clathrin-coated vesicle, or with an in vitro assembled clathrin coat, and recruits Hsc70 to its specific heavy-chain-binding site. We have determined by electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM), at about 11 A resolution, the structure of a clathrin coat (in the D6-barrel form) with specifically bound Hsc70 and auxilin. The Hsc70 binds a previously analysed site near the C-terminus of the heavy chain, with a stoichiometry of about one per three-fold vertex. Its binding is accompanied by a distortion of the clathrin lattice, detected by a change in the axial ratio of the D6 barrel. We propose that when Hsc70, recruited to a position close to its target by the auxilin J-domain, splits ATP, it clamps firmly onto its heavy-chain site and locks in place a transient fluctuation. Accumulation of the local strain thus imposed at multiple vertices can then lead to disassembly.},

	Abstract = {Papillomaviruses, members of a group of dsDNA viruses associated with epithelial growths and tumors, have compact capsids assembled from 72 pentamers of the protein L1. We have determined the structure of bovine papillomavirus by electron cryomicrosopy (cryoEM), at approximately 3.6 A resolution. The density map, obtained from single-particle analysis of approximately 4,000 particle images, shows the trace of the L1 polypeptide chain and reveals how the N- and C-terminal "arms" of a subunit (extensions from its beta-jelly-roll core) associate with a neighboring pentamer. Critical contacts come from the C-terminal arm, which loops out from the core of the subunit, forms contacts (including a disulfide) with two subunits in a neighboring pentamer, and reinserts into the pentamer from which it emanates. This trace corrects one feature of an earlier model. We discuss implications of the structure for virion assembly and for pathways of infectious viral entry. We suggest that it should be possible to obtain image reconstructions of comparable resolution from cryoEM images of asymmetric particles. From the work on papillomavirus described here, we estimate that such a reconstruction will require about 1.5 million images to achieve the same number of averaged asymmetric units; structural variability will increase this number substantially.},

	Abstract = {The Ndc80 complex is a key site of regulated kinetochore-microtubule attachment (a process required for cell division), but the molecular mechanism underlying its function remains unknown. Here we present a subnanometre-resolution cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of the human Ndc80 complex bound to microtubules, sufficient for precise docking of crystal structures of the component proteins. We find that the Ndc80 complex binds the microtubule with a tubulin monomer repeat, recognizing α- and β-tubulin at both intra- and inter-tubulin dimer interfaces in a manner that is sensitive to tubulin conformation. Furthermore, Ndc80 complexes self-associate along protofilaments through interactions mediated by the amino-terminal tail of the NDC80 protein, which is the site of phospho-regulation by Aurora B kinase. The complex's mode of interaction with the microtubule and its oligomerization suggest a mechanism by which Aurora B could regulate the stability of load-bearing kinetochore-microtubule attachments.},

	Abstract = {Non-enveloped viruses of different types have evolved distinct mechanisms for penetrating a cellular membrane during infection. Rotavirus penetration appears to occur by a process resembling enveloped-virus fusion: membrane distortion linked to conformational changes in a viral protein. Evidence for such a mechanism comes from crystallographic analyses of fragments of VP4, the rotavirus-penetration protein, and infectivity analyses of structure-based VP4 mutants. We describe here the structure of an infectious rotavirus particle determined by electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) and single-particle analysis at about 4.3 {\AA} resolution. The cryoEM image reconstruction permits a nearly complete trace of the VP4 polypeptide chain, including the positions of most side chains. It shows how the two subfragments of VP4 (VP8(*) and VP5(*)) retain their association after proteolytic cleavage, reveals multiple structural roles for the β-barrel domain of VP5(*), and specifies interactions of VP4 with other capsid proteins. The virion model allows us to integrate structural and functional information into a coherent mechanism for rotavirus entry.},

Aβ-peptide-derived assemblies might be crucial for disease onset, but determining their atomic structures has proven to be a major challenge. Progress over the past 5 years has yielded substantial new data obtained with improved methodologies including electron cryo-microscopy and NMR. It is now possible to resolve the global fibril topology and the cross-β sheet organization within protofilaments, and to identify residues that are crucial for stabilizing secondary structural elements and peptide conformations within specific assemblies.

@article{Lewandowski:2011aa,
	Abstract = {The molecular structure of amyloid fibrils and the mechanism of their formation are of substantial medical and biological importance, but present an ongoing experimental and computational challenge. An early high-resolution view of amyloid-like structure was obtained on amyloid-like crystals of a small fragment of the yeast prion protein Sup35p: the peptide GNNQQNY. As GNNQQNY also forms amyloid-like fibrils under similar conditions, it has been theorized that the crystal's structural features are shared by the fibrils. Here we apply magic-angle-spinning (MAS) NMR to examine the structure and dynamics of these fibrils. Previously multiple NMR signals were observed for such samples, seemingly consistent with the presence of polymorphic fibrils. Here we demonstrate that peptides with these three distinct conformations instead assemble together into composite protofilaments. Electron microscopy (EM) of the ribbon-like fibrils indicates that these protofilaments combine in differing ways to form striations of variable widths, presenting another level of structural complexity. Structural and dynamic NMR data reveal the presence of highly restricted side-chain conformations involved in interfaces between differently structured peptides, likely comprising interdigitated steric zippers. We outline molecular interfaces that are consistent with the observed EM and NMR data. The rigid and uniform structure of the GNNQQNY crystals is found to contrast distinctly with the more complex structural and dynamic nature of these "composite" amyloid fibrils. These results provide insight into the fibril-crystal distinction and also indicate a necessary caution with respect to the extrapolation of crystal structures to the study of fibril structure and formation.},

	Abstract = {The Wiener filter is a standard means of optimizing the signal in sums of aligned, noisy images obtained by electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM). However, estimation of the resolution-dependent ("spectral") signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) from the input data has remained problematic, and error reduction due to specific application of the SSNR term within a Wiener filter has not been reported. Here we describe an adjustment to the Wiener filter for optimal summation of images of isolated particles surrounded by large regions of featureless background, as is typically the case in single-particle cryo-EM applications. We show that the density within the particle area can be optimized, in the least-squares sense, by scaling the SSNR term found in the conventional Wiener filter by a factor that reflects the fraction of the image field occupied by the particle. We also give related expressions that allow the SSNR to be computed for application in this new filter, by incorporating a masking step into a Fourier Ring Correlation (FRC), a standard resolution measure. Furthermore, we show that this masked FRC estimation scheme substantially improves on the accuracy of conventional SSNR estimation methods. We demonstrate the validity of our new approach in numeric tests with simulated data corresponding to realistic cryo-EM imaging conditions. This variation of the Wiener filter and accompanying derivation should prove useful for a variety of single-particle cryo-EM applications, including 3D reconstruction.},

@article{Henderson:2011aa,
	Abstract = {The comparison of a pair of electron microscope images recorded at different specimen tilt angles provides a powerful approach for evaluating the quality of images, image-processing procedures, or three-dimensional structures. Here, we analyze tilt-pair images recorded from a range of specimens with different symmetries and molecular masses and show how the analysis can produce valuable information not easily obtained otherwise. We show that the accuracy of orientation determination of individual single particles depends on molecular mass, as expected theoretically since the information in each particle image increases with molecular mass. The angular uncertainty is less than 1$\,^{\circ}$ for particles of high molecular mass (~50 MDa), several degrees for particles in the range 1-5 MDa, and tens of degrees for particles below 1 MDa. Orientational uncertainty may be the major contributor to the effective temperature factor (B-factor) describing contrast loss and therefore the maximum resolution of a structure determination. We also made two unexpected observations. Single particles that are known to be flexible showed a wider spread in orientation accuracy, and the orientations of the largest particles examined changed by several degrees during typical low-dose exposures. Smaller particles presumably also reorient during the exposure; hence, specimen movement is a second major factor that limits resolution. Tilt pairs thus enable assessment of orientation accuracy, map quality, specimen motion, and conformational heterogeneity. A convincing tilt-pair parameter plot, where 60% of the particles show a single cluster around the expected tilt axis and tilt angle, provides confidence in a structure determined using electron cryomicroscopy.},

	Abstract = {The contrast observed in images of frozen-hydrated biological specimens prepared for electron cryo-microscopy falls significantly short of theoretical predictions. In addition to limits imposed by the current instrumentation, it is widely acknowledged that motion of the specimen during its exposure to the electron beam leads to significant blurring in the recorded images. We have studied the amount and direction of motion of virus particles suspended in thin vitrified ice layers across holes in perforated carbon films using exposure series. Our data show that the particle motion is correlated within patches of 0.3-0.5 μm, indicating that the whole ice layer is moving in a drum-like motion, with accompanying particle rotations of up to a few degrees. Support films with smaller holes, as well as lower electron dose rates tend to reduce beam-induced specimen motion, consistent with a mechanical effect. Finally, analysis of movies showing changes in the specimen during beam exposure show that the specimen moves significantly more at the start of an exposure than towards its end. We show how alignment and averaging of movie frames can be used to restore high-resolution detail in images affected by beam-induced motion.},

	Abstract = {The high noise level found in single-particle electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) image data presents a special challenge for three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the imaged molecules. The spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) and related Fourier shell correlation (FSC) functions are commonly used to assess and mitigate the noise-generated error in the reconstruction. Calculation of the SSNR and FSC usually includes the noise in the solvent region surrounding the particle and therefore does not accurately reflect the signal in the particle density itself. Here we show that the SSNR in a reconstructed 3D particle map is linearly proportional to the fractional volume occupied by the particle. Using this relationship, we devise a novel filter (the "single-particle Wiener filter") to minimize the error in a reconstructed particle map, if the particle volume is known. Moreover, we show how to approximate this filter even when the volume of the particle is not known, by optimizing the signal within a representative interior region of the particle. We show that the new filter improves on previously proposed error-reduction schemes, including the conventional Wiener filter as well as figure-of-merit weighting, and quantify the relationship between all of these methods by theoretical analysis as well as numeric evaluation of both simulated and experimentally collected data. The single-particle Wiener filter is applicable across a broad range of existing 3D reconstruction techniques, but is particularly well suited to the Fourier inversion method, leading to an efficient and accurate implementation.},

The process starts by formation of a metastable prohead, poised for exothermic expansion triggered by DNA packaging. During maturation, the capsid subunit transitions from a strained to a canonical tertiary conformation and this has been postulated to be the driving mechanism for initiating expansion via switching hexameric capsomer architecture from skewed to 6-fold symmetric. We report the subnanometer electron-cryomicroscopy reconstruction of the HK97 first expansion intermediate before any crosslink formation. This form displays 6-fold symmetric hexamers, but capsid subunit tertiary structures exhibit distortions comparable to the prohead forms. We propose that coat subunit strain release acts in synergy with the first crosslinks to drive forward maturation. Finally, we speculate that the energetic features of this transition may result from increased stability of intermediates during maturation via enhanced inter-subunit interactions.},

	Abstract = {Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses transcribe and replicate RNA within an assembled, inner capsid particle; only plus-sense mRNA emerges into the intracellular milieu. During infectious entry of a rotavirus particle, the outer layer of its three-layer structure dissociates, delivering the inner double-layered particle (DLP) into the cytosol. DLP structures determined by X-ray crystallography and electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) show that the RNA coils uniformly into the particle interior, avoiding a "fivefold hub" of more structured density projecting inward from the VP2 shell of the DLP along each of the twelve 5-fold axes. Analysis of the X-ray crystallographic electron density map suggested that principal contributors to the hub are the N-terminal arms of VP2, but reexamination of the cryoEM map has shown that many features come from a molecule of VP1, randomly occupying five equivalent and partly overlapping positions. We confirm here that the electron density in the X-ray map leads to the same conclusion, and we describe the functional implications of the orientation and position of the polymerase. The exit channel for the nascent transcript directs the nascent transcript toward an opening along the 5-fold axis. The template strand enters from within the particle, and the dsRNA product of the initial replication step exits in a direction tangential to the inner surface of the VP2 shell, allowing it to coil optimally within the DLP. The polymerases of reoviruses appear to have similar positions and functional orientations.},

We test the FREALIGN implementation using a simulated dataset containing computer-generated projection images of three different 70S ribosome structures, as well as a publicly available dataset of 70S ribosomes. The results show that the mixed strategy of the new FREALIGN algorithm yields performance on par with other maximum likelihood implementations, while remaining computationally efficient.},

We have developed an easy-to-use software tool, FindDQE, to measure MTF and DQE of electron detectors using images of a microscope's built-in beam stop. Using this software, we have determined the DQE curves of four direct electron detectors currently available: the Gatan K2 Summit, the FEI Falcon I and II, and the Direct Electron DE-12, under a variety of total dose and dose rate conditions. We have additionally measured the curves for the Gatan US4000 and TVIPS TemCam-F416 scintillator-based cameras. We compare the results from our new method with published curves.},

This public-domain software package was introduced to the electron microscopy field eight years ago, and since then it has changed drastically. New methodologies for the analysis of single-particle projection images have been added to classification, contrast transfer function correction, angular assignment, 3D reconstruction, reconstruction of crystals, etc. In addition, the package has been extended with functionalities for 2D crystal and electron tomography data. Furthermore, its current implementation in C++, with a highly modular design of well-documented data structures and functions, offers a convenient environment for the development of novel algorithms. In this paper, we present a general overview of a new generation of Xmipp that has been re-engineered to maximize flexibility and modularity, potentially facilitating its integration in future standardization efforts in the field. Moreover, by focusing on those developments that distinguish Xmipp from other packages available, we illustrate its added value to the electron microscopy community.},

SPI-EM is a new tool for determining the homologous superfamily to which a protein domain belongs looking at its three-dimensional electron microscopy map. The homologous superfamily is assigned according to the domain-architecture database CATH. Our method follows a probabilistic approach applied to the results of fitting protein domains into maps of proteins and the computation of local cross-correlation coefficient measures. The method has been tested and its usefulness proven with isolated domains at a resolution of 8 A and 12 A. Results obtained with simulated and experimental data at 10 A suggest that it is also feasible to detect the correct superfamily of the domains when dealing with electron microscopy maps containing multi-domain proteins. The inherent difficulties and limitations that multi-domain proteins impose are discussed. Our procedure is complementary to other techniques existing in the field to detect structural elements in electron microscopy maps like alpha-helices and beta-sheets. Based on the proposed methodology, a database of relevant distributions is being built to serve the community.},

	Abstract = {A maximum-likelihood approach to multi-reference image refinement is presented. In contrast to conventional cross-correlation refinement, the new approach includes a formal description of the noise, implying that it is especially suited to cases with low signal-to-noise ratios. Application of this approach to a cryo-electron microscopy dataset revealed two major classes for projections of simian virus 40 large T-antigen in complex with an asymmetric DNA-probe, containing the origin of simian virus 40 replication. Strongly bent projections of dodecamers showed density that may be attributed to the complexed double-stranded DNA, while almost straight projections revealed a twist in the relative orientation of the hexameric subunits. This new level of detail for large T-antigen projections was not detected using conventional techniques. For a negative stain dataset, maximum-likelihood refinement yielded results that were practically identical to those obtained using conventional multi-reference refinement. Results obtained using simulated data suggest that the efficiency of the maximum-likelihood approach may be further enhanced by explicitly incorporating the microscope contrast transfer function in the image formation model.},

The effectiveness of the procedure, which is based on classification of single-projection reconstructions (SPRs), is first investigated using simulated data. Of several reconstruction approaches examined, best results were obtained with algebraic reconstruction techniques (ART) when providing prior information about the reconstruction in the form of a starting volume. The results presented indicate that SPR-classification is sufficiently sensitive to classify assemblies with differences of only a few percent of the total mass. The usefulness of this procedure is illustrated by application to a heterogeneous cryo-electron microscopy dataset of adenovirus mutant dl313, lacking minor coat protein IX. These data were successfully divided into two distinct classes, in agreement with gel analysis and immuno-electron microscopy results. The classes yielded a wildtype-like reconstruction and a reconstruction representing the polypeptide IX-deficient dl313 virion. As the largest difference between these volumes is found at the location previously assigned to the external portion of minor coat protein polypeptide IIIa, questions arise concerning the current adenovirus model.},

Maximum likelihood approaches are emerging as robust tools for solving the image classification problems that are posed by such samples. Here, we propose a statistical data model that allows for a description of the experimental image formation within the formulation of 2D and 3D maximum-likelihood refinement. The proposed approach comprises a formulation of the probability calculations in Fourier space, including a spatial frequency-dependent noise model and a description of defocus-dependent imaging effects. The Expectation-Maximization-like algorithms presented are generally applicable to the alignment and classification of structurally heterogeneous projection data.

	Abstract = {During protein synthesis, tRNAs and mRNA move through the ribosome between aminoacyl (A), peptidyl (P), and exit (E) sites of the ribosome in a process called translocation. Translocation is accompanied by the displacement of the tRNAs on the large ribosomal subunit toward the hybrid A/P and P/E states and by a rotational movement (ratchet) of the ribosomal subunits relative to one another. So far, the structure of the ratcheted state has been observed only when translation factors were bound to the ribosome. Using cryo-electron microscopy and classification, we show here that ribosomes can spontaneously adopt a ratcheted conformation with tRNAs in their hybrid states. The peptidyl-tRNA molecule in the A/P state, which is visualized here, is not distorted compared with the A/A state except for slight adjustments of its acceptor end, suggesting that the displacement of the A-site tRNA on the 50S subunit is passive and is induced by the 30S subunit rotation. Simultaneous subunit ratchet and formation of the tRNA hybrid states precede and may promote the subsequent rapid and coordinated tRNA translocation on the 30S subunit catalyzed by elongation factor G.},

	Abstract = {Maturation via proteolytic processing is a common trait in the viral world and is often accompanied by large conformational changes and rearrangements in the capsid. The adenovirus protease has been shown to play a dual role in the viral infectious cycle: (a) in maturation, as viral assembly starts with precursors to several of the structural proteins but ends with proteolytically processed versions in the mature virion, and (b) in entry, because protease-impaired viruses have difficulties in endosome escape and uncoating. Indeed, viruses that have not undergone proteolytic processing are not infectious. We studied the three-dimensional structure of immature adenovirus particles as represented by the adenovirus type 2 thermosensitive mutant ts1 grown under non-permissive conditions and compared it with the mature capsid. Our three-dimensional electron microscopy maps at subnanometer resolution indicate that adenovirus maturation does not involve large-scale conformational changes in the capsid. Difference maps reveal the locations of unprocessed peptides pIIIa and pVI and help define their role in capsid assembly and maturation. An intriguing difference appears in the core, indicating a more compact organization and increased stability of the immature cores. We have further investigated these properties by in vitro disassembly assays. Fluorescence and electron microscopy experiments reveal differences in the stability and uncoating of immature viruses, both at the capsid and core levels, as well as disassembly intermediates not previously imaged.},

	Abstract = {Cryo-electron microscopy in conjunction with advanced image analysis was used to analyze the structure of the 26S proteasome and to elucidate its variable features. We have been able to outline the boundaries of the ATPase module in the "base" part of the regulatory complex that can vary in its position and orientation relative to the 20S core particle. This variation is consistent with the "wobbling" model that was previously proposed to explain the role of the regulatory complex in opening the gate in the alpha-rings of the core particle. In addition, a variable mass near the mouth of the ATPase ring has been identified as Rpn10, a multiubiquitin receptor, by correlating the electron microscopy data with quantitative mass spectrometry.},

	Abstract = {The DNA ligase IV-Xrcc4 complex is responsible for the ligation of broken DNA ends in the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway of DNA double strand break repair in mammals. Mutations in DNA ligase IV (Lig4) lead to immunodeficiency and radiosensitivity in humans. Only partial structural information for Lig4 and Xrcc4 is available, while the structure of the full-length proteins and their arrangement within the Lig4-Xrcc4 complex is unknown. The C-terminal domain of Xrcc4, whose structure has not been solved, contains phosphorylation sites for DNA-PKcs and is phylogenetically conserved, indicative of a regulatory role in NHEJ. Here, we have purified full length Xrcc4 and the Lig4-Xrcc4 complex, and analysed their structure by single-particle electron microscopy. The three-dimensional structure of Xrcc4 at a resolution of approximately 37A reveals that the C-terminus of Xrcc4 forms a dimeric globular domain connected to the N-terminus by a coiled-coil. The N- and C-terminal domains of Xrcc4 locate at opposite ends of an elongated molecule. The electron microscopy images of the Lig4-Xrcc4 complex were examined by two-dimensional image processing and a double-labelling strategy, identifying the site of the C-terminus of Xrcc4 and the catalytic core of Lig4 within the complex. The catalytic domains of Lig4 were found to be in the vicinity of the N-terminus of Xrcc4. We provide a first sight of the structural organization of the Lig4-Xrcc4 complex, which suggests that the BRCT domains could provide the link of the ligase to Xrcc4 while permitting some movements of the catalytic domains of Lig4. This arrangement may facilitate the ligation of diverse configurations of damaged DNA.},

	Abstract = {Bacterial ribosomes stalled on faulty, often truncated, mRNAs lacking stop codons are rescued by trans-translation. It relies on an RNA molecule (tmRNA) capable of replacing the faulty mRNA with its own open reading frame (ORF). Translation of tmRNA ORF results in the tagging of faulty protein for degradation and its release from the ribosome. We used single-particle cryo-electron microscopy to visualize tmRNA together with its helper protein SmpB on the 70S Escherichia coli ribosome in states subsequent to GTP hydrolysis on elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu). Three-dimensional reconstruction and heterogeneity analysis resulted in a 15A resolution structure of the tmRNA.SmpB complex accommodated in the A site of the ribosome, which shows that SmpB mimics the anticodon- and D-stem of native tRNAs missing in the tRNA-like domain of tmRNA. We conclude that the tmRNA.SmpB complex accommodates in the ribosomal A site very much like an aminoacyl-tRNA during protein elongation.},

	Abstract = {The Simian virus 40 (SV40) large tumor antigen (LTag) functions as the replicative helicase and initiator for viral DNA replication. For SV40 replication, the first essential step is the assembly of an LTag double hexamer at the origin DNA that will subsequently melt the origin DNA to initiate fork unwinding. In this study, we used three-dimensional cryo-electron microscopy to visualize early events in the activation of DNA replication in the SV40 model system. We obtained structures of wild-type double-hexamer complexes of LTag bound to SV40 origin DNA, to which atomic structures have been fitted. Wild-type LTag was observed in two distinct conformations: In one conformation, the central module containing the J-domains and the origin binding domains of both hexamers is a compact closed ring. In the other conformation, the central module is an open ring with a gap formed by rearrangement of the N-terminal regions of the two hexamers, potentially allowing for the passage of single-stranded DNA generated from the melted origin DNA. Double-hexamer complexes containing mutant LTag that lacks the N-terminal J-domain show the central module predominantly in the closed-ring state. Analyses of the LTag C-terminal regions reveal that the LTag hexamers bound to the A/T-rich tract origin of replication and early palindrome origin of replication elements are structurally distinct. Lastly, visualization of DNA density protruding from the LTag C-terminal domains suggests that oligomerization of the LTag complex takes place on double-stranded DNA.},

	Abstract = {Classification and averaging of sub-tomograms can improve the fidelity and resolution of structures obtained by electron tomography. Here we present a three-dimensional (3D) maximum likelihood algorithm--MLTOMO--which is characterized by integrating 3D alignment and classification into a single, unified processing step. The novelty of our approach lies in the way we calculate the probability of observing an individual sub-tomogram for a given reference structure. We assume that the reference structure is affected by a 'compound wedge', resulting from the summation of many individual missing wedges in distinct orientations. The distance metric underlying our probability calculations effectively down-weights Fourier components that are observed less frequently. Simulations demonstrate that MLTOMO clearly outperforms the 'constrained correlation' approach and has advantages over existing approaches in cases where the sub-tomograms adopt preferred orientations. Application of our approach to cryo-electron tomographic data of ice-embedded thermosomes revealed distinct conformations that are in good agreement with results obtained by previous single particle studies.},

@article{Muench:2014aa,
	Abstract = {The vacuolar H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) is an ATP-driven proton pump essential to the function of eukaryotic cells. Its cytoplasmic V1 domain is an ATPase, normally coupled to membrane-bound proton pump Vo via a rotary mechanism. How these asymmetric motors are coupled remains poorly understood. Low energy status can trigger release of V1 from the membrane and curtail ATP hydrolysis. To investigate the molecular basis for these processes, we have carried out cryo-electron microscopy three-dimensional reconstruction of deactivated V1 from Manduca sexta. In the resulting model, three peripheral stalks that are parts of the mechanical stator of the V-ATPase are clearly resolved as unsupported filaments in the same conformations as in the holoenzyme. They are likely therefore to have inherent stiffness consistent with a role as flexible rods in buffering elastic power transmission between the domains of the V-ATPase. Inactivated V1 adopted a homogeneous resting state with one open active site adjacent to the stator filament normally linked to the H subunit. Although present at 1:1 stoichiometry with V1, both recombinant subunit C reconstituted with V1 and its endogenous subunit H were poorly resolved in three-dimensional reconstructions, suggesting structural heterogeneity in the region at the base of V1 that could indicate positional variability. If the position of H can vary, existing mechanistic models of deactivation in which it binds to and locks the axle of the V-ATPase rotary motor would need to be re-evaluated.},

Consequently, EM samples often contain a mixture of different structural states. This structural variability has long been regarded as a severe hindrance for single-particle analysis because the combination of projections from different structures into a single reconstruction may cause severe artifacts. This chapter reviews recent developments in image processing that may turn structural variability from an obstacle into an advantage. Modern algorithms now allow classifying projection images according to their underlying three-dimensional (3D) structures, so that multiple reconstructions may be obtained from a single data set.

	Abstract = {The multidomain homotetrameric tumor suppressor p53 has two modes of binding dsDNA that are thought to be responsible for scanning and recognizing specific response elements (REs). The C termini bind nonspecifically to dsDNA. The four DNA-binding domains (DBDs) bind REs that have two symmetric 10 base-pair sequences. p53 bound to a 20-bp RE has the DBDs enveloping the DNA, which is in the center of the molecule surrounded by linker sequences to the tetramerization domain (Tet). We investigated by electron microscopy structures of p53 bound to DNA sequences consisting of a 20-bp RE with either 12 or 20 bp nonspecific extensions on either end. We found a variety of structures that give clues to recognition and scanning mechanisms. The 44- and 60-bp sequences gave rise to three and four classes of structures, respectively. One was similar to the known 20-bp structure, but the DBDs in the other classes were loosely arranged and incompatible with specific DNA recognition. Some of the complexes had density consistent with the C termini extending from Tet to the DNA, adjacent to the DBDs. Single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments detected the approach of the C termini towards the DBDs on addition of DNA. The structural data are consistent with p53 sliding along DNA via its C termini and the DNA-binding domains hopping on and off during searches for REs. The loose structures and posttranslational modifications account for the affinity of nonspecific DNA for p53 and point to a mechanism of enhancement of specificity by its binding to effector proteins.},

	Abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) structure determination by single-particle analysis of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) images requires many parameters to be determined from extremely noisy data. This makes the method prone to overfitting, that is, when structures describe noise rather than signal, in particular near their resolution limit where noise levels are highest. Cryo-EM structures are typically filtered using ad hoc procedures to prevent overfitting, but the tuning of arbitrary parameters may lead to subjectivity in the results. I describe a Bayesian interpretation of cryo-EM structure determination, where smoothness in the reconstructed density is imposed through a Gaussian prior in the Fourier domain. The statistical framework dictates how data and prior knowledge should be combined, so that the optimal 3D linear filter is obtained without the need for arbitrariness and objective resolution estimates may be obtained. Application to experimental data indicates that the statistical approach yields more reliable structures than existing methods and is capable of detecting smaller classes in data sets that contain multiple different structures.},

Whereas alternative approaches often rely on user expertise for the tuning of parameters, RELION uses a Bayesian approach to infer parameters of a statistical model from the data. This paper describes developments that reduce the computational costs of the underlying maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithm, as well as statistical considerations that yield new insights into the accuracy with which the relative orientations of individual particles may be determined. A so-called gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) procedure to prevent overfitting is also described. The resulting implementation yields high-quality reconstructions and reliable resolution estimates with minimal user intervention and at acceptable computational costs.},

	Abstract = {Although electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) single-particle analysis has become an important tool for structural biology of large and flexible macro-molecular assemblies, the technique has not yet reached its full potential. Besides fundamental limits imposed by radiation damage, poor detectors and beam-induced sample movement have been shown to degrade attainable resolutions. A new generation of direct electron detectors may ameliorate both effects. Apart from exhibiting improved signal-to-noise performance, these cameras are also fast enough to follow particle movements during electron irradiation. Here, we assess the potentials of this technology for cryo-EM structure determination. Using a newly developed statistical movie processing approach to compensate for beam-induced movement, we show that ribosome reconstructions with unprecedented resolutions may be calculated from almost two orders of magnitude fewer particles than used previously. Therefore, this methodology may expand the scope of high-resolution cryo-EM to a broad range of biological specimens.DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00461.001.},

This step is catalyzed by initiation factor eIF5B. We used recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine a structure of the eIF5B initiation complex to 6.6 angstrom resolution from <3% of the population, comprising just 5143 particles. The structure reveals conformational changes in eIF5B, initiator tRNA, and the ribosome that provide insights into the role of eIF5B in translational initiation.

	Abstract = {The major light harvesting complex in cyanobacteria and red algae is the phycobilisome (PBS), comprised of hundreds of seemingly similar chromophores, which are protein bound and assembled in a fashion that enables highly efficient uni-directional energy transfer to reaction centers. The PBS is comprised of a core containing 2-5 cylinders surrounded by 6-8 rods, and a number of models have been proposed describing the PBS structure. One of the most critical steps in the functionality of the PBS is energy transfer from the rod substructures to the core substructure. In this study we compare the structural and functional characteristics of high-phosphate stabilized PBS (the standard fashion of stabilization of isolated complexes) with cross-linked PBS in low ionic strength buffer from two cyanobacterial species, Thermosynechococcus vulcanus and Acaryochloris marina. We show that chemical cross-linking preserves efficient energy transfer from the phycocyanin containing rods to the allophycocyanin containing cores with fluorescent emission from the terminal emitters. However, this energy transfer is shown to exist in PBS complexes of different structures as characterized by determination of a 2.4{\AA} structure by X-ray crystallography, single crystal confocal microscopy, mass spectrometry and transmission electron microscopy of negatively stained and cryogenically preserved complexes. We conclude that the PBS has intrinsic structural properties that enable efficient energy transfer from rod substructures to the core substructures without requiring a single unique structure. We discuss the significance of our observations on the functionality of the PBS in vivo.},

We here present a structure model of Arabidopsis thaliana Hsp21, obtained by homology modeling, single-particle electron microscopy, and lysine-specific chemical crosslinking. The model shows that the Hsp21 subunits are arranged in two hexameric discs, similar to a cytosolic plant sHsp homolog that has been structurally determined after crystallization. However, the two hexameric discs of Hsp21 are rotated by 25$\,^{\circ}$ in relation to each other, suggesting a role for global dynamics in dodecamer function.},

	Abstract = {Cobalamins belong to the tetrapyrrole family of prosthetic groups. The presence of a metal ion is a key feature of these compounds. In the oxygen-dependent (aerobic) cobalamin biosynthetic pathway, cobalt is inserted into a ring-contracted tetrapyrrole called hydrogenobyrinic acid a,c-diamide (HBAD) by a cobaltochelatase that is constituted by three subunits, CobN, CobS and CobT, with molecular masses of 137, 37 and 71kDa, respectively. Based on the similarities with magnesium chelatase, cobaltochelatase has been suggested to belong to the AAA(+) superfamily of proteins. In this paper we present the cloning of the Brucella melitensis cobN, cobS and cobT, the purification of the encoded protein products, and a single-particle reconstruction of the macromolecular assembly formed between CobS and CobT from negatively stained electron microscopy images of the complex. The results show for the first time that subunits CobS and CobT form a chaperone-like complex, characteristic for the AAA(+) class of proteins. The molecules are arranged in a two-tiered ring structure with the six subunits in each ring organized as a trimer of dimers. The similarity between this structure and that of magnesium chelatase, as well as analysis of the amino acid sequences confirms the suggested evolutionary relationship between the two enzymes.},

In agreement with predictions, hTAF12 forms a histone fold that is very similar to that of histone H2B, yet unexpected differences are observed between the structures of the hTAF12 interaction domain of hTAF4 and histone H2A. Most importantly, the hTAF4 fragment forms only the first two helices of a classical histone fold, which are followed by a 26-residue disordered region. This indicates that either full-length TAF4 contains an unusually long connecting loop between its second and third helix, and this helix is not required for stable interaction with TAF12, or that TAF4 represents a novel class of partial histone fold motifs. Structural models and structure-based sequence alignments support a role for TAF4b and hSTAF42/yADA1 as alternative partners for TAF12 and are consistent with the formation of nucleosome-like histone-fold octamers through interaction of TAF12 with a TAF6-TAF9 tetramer, yet argue against involvement of TAF12-containing histone-fold pairs in DNA binding.},

BTAF1 has been proposed to play a key role in the dynamic regulation of TBP function in RNA polymerase II transcription. We have determined the structure of native B-TFIID purified from human cells by electron microscopy and by image analysis of single particles at a resolution of 28 A. B-TFIID is 15 x 9 nm in size and is organized into a large domain of about 170 kDa, which can be subdivided into two domains. Extending from this domain is a long thumb, which in turn is divided into subdomains of about 25, 15, and 35 kDa, the largest of which is located at the end of the thumb. Immunolabeling experiments localize the extreme carboxyl terminus of BTAF1 within the 170-kDa domain, whereas the amino terminus and TBP co-localize to the end of the protruding thumb. The central portion of BTAF1 localizes to the base of the thumb. Comparison of the native B-TFIID with its recombinant form shows that both share a similar domain organization. Collectively, these data provide the first structural model of the B-TFIID complex and map its key functional domains.},

The BTAF1 protein (formerly known as TAF(II)170/TAF-172 and the human ortholog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mot1p) and the NC2 complex composed of NC2alpha (DRAP1) and NC2beta (Dr1) are able to bind to TBP directly and regulate RNA polymerase II transcription both positively and negatively. Here, we present evidence that the NC2alpha subunit interacts with BTAF1. In contrast, the NC2beta subunit is not able to associate with BTAF1 and seems to interfere with the BTAF1-TBP interaction. Addition of NC2alpha or the NC2 complex can stimulate the ability of BTAF1 to interact with TBP. This function is dependent on the presence of ATP in cell extracts but does not involve the ATPase activity of BTAF1 nor phosphorylation of NC2alpha. Together, our results constitute the first evidence of the physical cooperation between BTAF1 and NC2alpha in TBP regulation and provide a framework to understand transcription functions of NC2alpha and NC2beta in vivo.},

	Abstract = {Sequence-specific DNA-binding activators, key regulators of gene expression, stimulate transcription in part by targeting the core promoter recognition TFIID complex and aiding in its recruitment to promoter DNA. Although it has been established that activators can interact with multiple components of TFIID, it is unknown whether common or distinct surfaces within TFIID are targeted by activators and what changes if any in the structure of TFIID may occur upon binding activators. As a first step toward structurally dissecting activator/TFIID interactions, we determined the three-dimensional structures of TFIID bound to three distinct activators (i.e., the tumor suppressor p53 protein, glutamine-rich Sp1 and the oncoprotein c-Jun) and compared their structures as determined by electron microscopy and single-particle reconstruction. By a combination of EM and biochemical mapping analysis, our results uncover distinct contact regions within TFIID bound by each activator. Unlike the coactivator CRSP/Mediator complex that undergoes drastic and global structural changes upon activator binding, instead, a rather confined set of local conserved structural changes were observed when each activator binds holo-TFIID. These results suggest that activator contact may induce unique structural features of TFIID, thus providing nanoscale information on activator-dependent TFIID assembly and transcription initiation.},

	Abstract = {The transcription factor TFIID is a large multiprotein complex, composed of the TATA box-binding protein (TBP) and 14 TBP-associated factors (TAFs), which plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression by RNA polymerase II. The three-dimensional structure of yeast (y) TFIID, determined at approximately 3 nm resolution by electron microscopy and image analysis, resembles a molecular clamp formed by three major lobes connected by thin linking domains. The yTFIID is structurally similar to the human factor although the clamp appears more closed in the yeast complex, probably reflecting the conformational flexibility of the structure. Immunolabelling experiments showed that nine TAFs that contain the histone fold structural motif were located in three distinct substructures of TFIID. The distribution of these TAFs showed that the previously reported pair-wise interactions between histone fold domain (HFD)-containing TAFs are likely to occur in the native yTFIID complex. Most of the HFD-containing TAFs have been found in two distinct lobes, thus revealing an unexpected and novel molecular organization of TFIID.},

	Abstract = {We demonstrate two ways in which the Fourier transforms of images that consist solely of randomly distributed electrons (shot noise) can be used to compare the relative performance of different electronic cameras. The principle is to determine how closely the Fourier transform of a given image does, or does not, approach that of an image produced by an ideal camera, i.e. one for which single-electron events are modeled as Kronecker delta functions located at the same pixels where the electrons were incident on the camera. Experimentally, the average width of the single-electron response is characterized by fitting a single Lorentzian function to the azimuthally averaged amplitude of the Fourier transform. The reciprocal of the spatial frequency at which the Lorentzian function falls to a value of 0.5 provides an estimate of the number of pixels at which the corresponding line-spread function falls to a value of 1/e. In addition, the excess noise due to stochastic variations in the magnitude of the response of the camera (for single-electron events) is characterized by the amount to which the appropriately normalized power spectrum does, or does not, exceed the total number of electrons in the image. These simple measurements provide an easy way to evaluate the relative performance of different cameras. To illustrate this point we present data for three different types of scintillator-coupled camera plus a silicon-pixel (direct detection) camera.},

	Abstract = {Gene transcription is regulated in response to environmental changes and developmental cues. In mammalian cells subjected to stress conditions such as heat shock, transcription of most protein-coding genes decreases, while the transcription of heat shock protein genes increases. Repression involves direct binding to RNA polymerase II (Pol II) of certain noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) that are upregulated upon heat shock. Another class of ncRNAs is also upregulated and binds to Pol II but does not inhibit transcription. Incorporation of repressive ncRNAs into pre-initiation complexes prevents transcription initiation, while non-repressive ncRNAs are displaced from Pol II by TFIIF. Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of human Pol II in complex with six different ncRNAs from mouse and human. Our structures show that both repressive and non-repressive ncRNAs bind to a conserved binding site within the cleft of Pol II. The site, which is also shared with a previously characterized yeast aptamer, is close to the active center and, thus, in an ideal position to regulate transcription. Importantly, additional RNA elements extend flexibly beyond the docking site. We propose that the differences concerning the repressive activity of the ncRNAs analyzed must be due to the distinct character of these more unstructured, flexible segments of the RNA that emanate from the cleft.},

@article{Grob:2012aa,
	Abstract = {The repair of DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) is essential for cell viability and genome stability. Aberrant repair of DSBs has been linked with cancer predisposition and aging. During the repair of DSBs by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), DNA ends are brought together, processed and then joined. In eukaryotes, this repair pathway is initiated by the binding of the ring-shaped Ku heterodimer and completed by DNA ligase IV. The DNA ligase IV complex, DNA ligase IV/XRRC4 in humans and Dnl4/Lif1 in yeast, is recruited to DNA ends in vitro and in vivo by an interaction with Ku and, in yeast, Dnl4/Lif1 stabilizes the binding of yKu to in vivo DSBs. Here we have analyzed the interactions of these functionally conserved eukaryotic NHEJ factors with DNA by electron microscopy. As expected, the ring-shaped Ku complex bound stably and specifically to DNA ends at physiological salt concentrations. At a ratio of 1 Ku molecule per DNA end, the majority of DNA ends were occupied by a single Ku complex with no significant formation of linear DNA multimers or circular loops. Both Dnl4/Lif1 and DNA ligase IV/XRCC4 formed complexes with Ku-bound DNA ends, resulting in intra- and intermolecular DNA end bridging, even with non-ligatable DNA ends. Together, these studies, which provide the first visualization of the conserved complex formed by Ku and DNA ligase IV at juxtaposed DNA ends by electron microscopy, suggest that the DNA ligase IV complex mediates end-bridging by engaging two Ku-bound DNA ends.},

	Abstract = {The macromolecular assembly required to initiate transcription of protein-coding genes, known as the Pre-Initiation Complex (PIC), consists of multiple protein complexes and is approximately 3.5 MDa in size. At the heart of this assembly is the Mediator complex, which helps regulate PIC activity and interacts with the RNA polymerase II (pol II) enzyme. The structure of the human Mediator-pol II interface is not well-characterized, whereas attempts to structurally define the Mediator-pol II interaction in yeast have relied on incomplete assemblies of Mediator and/or pol II and have yielded inconsistent interpretations. We have assembled the complete, 1.9 MDa human Mediator-pol II-TFIIF complex from purified components and have characterized its structural organization using cryo-electron microscopy and single-particle reconstruction techniques. The orientation of pol II within this assembly was determined by crystal structure docking and further validated with projection matching experiments, allowing the structural organization of the entire human PIC to be envisioned. Significantly, pol II orientation within the Mediator-pol II-TFIIF assembly can be reconciled with past studies that determined the location of other PIC components relative to pol II itself. Pol II surfaces required for interacting with TFIIB, TFIIE, and promoter DNA (i.e., the pol II cleft) are exposed within the Mediator-pol II-TFIIF structure; RNA exit is unhindered along the RPB4/7 subunits; upstream and downstream DNA is accessible for binding additional factors; and no major structural re-organization is necessary to accommodate the large, multi-subunit TFIIH or TFIID complexes. The data also reveal how pol II binding excludes Mediator-CDK8 subcomplex interactions and provide a structural basis for Mediator-dependent control of PIC assembly and function. Finally, parallel structural analysis of Mediator-pol II complexes lacking TFIIF reveal that TFIIF plays a key role in stabilizing pol II orientation within the assembly.},

Small variations in background mean or signal brightness are relatively common in cryo-electron microscopy data, and varying signal-to-noise ratios or artifacts in the images interfere with standard normalization procedures. In this paper, a statistical data model that accounts for normalization errors is presented, and a corresponding algorithm for maximum likelihood classification of structurally heterogeneous projection data is derived. The extended data model has general relevance, since similar algorithms may be derived for other maximum likelihood approaches in the field. The potentials of this approach are illustrated for two structurally heterogeneous data sets: 70S E.coli ribosomes and human RNA polymerase II complexes. In both cases, maximum likelihood classification based on the conventional data model failed, whereas the new approach was capable of revealing previously unobserved conformations.},

As a first step toward correlating potential structure/function relationships of the prototypic TFIID versus 4b/4-IID, we have compared their 3D structures by electron microscopy and single-particle reconstruction. These studies reveal that TAF4b incorporation into TFIID induces an open conformation at the lobe involved in TFIIA and putative activator interactions. Importantly, this open conformation correlates with differential activator-dependent transcription and promoter recognition by 4b/4-IID. By combining functional and structural analysis, we find that distinct localized structural changes in a megadalton macromolecular assembly can significantly alter its activity and lead to a TAF4b-induced reprogramming of promoter specificity.},

Although the complexes have the same protein composition and high sequence similarity, understanding of transcription and of transcription-coupled DNA repair (TCR) in humans will require the use of human proteins in structural studies. We have used cryo-electron microscopy, image reconstruction, and variance analysis to characterize the structure and dynamics of human RNAPII (hRNAPII). Our studies show that hRNAPII in solution parallels the conformational flexibility of the yeast structures crystallized in different states but also illustrate a more extensive conformational range with potential biological significance. This hRNAPII study will serve as a structural platform to build up higher-order transcription and TCR complexes and to gain information that may be unique to the human RNAPII system.},

@article{Papai:2010ab,
	Abstract = {Transcription of eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding genes by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is triggered by the binding of transactivating proteins to enhancer DNA, which stimulates the recruitment of general transcription factors (TFIIA, B, D, E, F, H) and Pol II on the cis-linked promoter, leading to pre-initiation complex formation and transcription. In TFIID-dependent activation pathways, this general transcription factor containing TATA-box-binding protein is first recruited on the promoter through interaction with activators and cooperates with TFIIA to form a committed pre-initiation complex. However, neither the mechanisms by which activation signals are communicated between these factors nor the structural organization of the activated pre-initiation complex are known. Here we used cryo-electron microscopy to determine the architecture of nucleoprotein complexes composed of TFIID, TFIIA, the transcriptional activator Rap1 and yeast enhancer-promoter DNA. These structures revealed the mode of binding of Rap1 and TFIIA to TFIID, as well as a reorganization of TFIIA induced by its interaction with Rap1. We propose that this change in position increases the exposure of TATA-box-binding protein within TFIID, consequently enhancing its ability to interact with the promoter. A large Rap1-dependent DNA loop forms between the activator-binding site and the proximal promoter region. This loop is topologically locked by a TFIIA-Rap1 protein bridge that folds over the DNA. These results highlight the role of TFIIA in transcriptional activation, define a molecular mechanism for enhancer-promoter communication and provide structural insights into the pathways of intramolecular communication that convey transcription activation signals through the TFIID complex.},

@article{Bieniossek:2013aa,
	Abstract = {The initiation of gene transcription by RNA polymerase II is regulated by a plethora of proteins in human cells. The first general transcription factor to bind gene promoters is transcription factor IID (TFIID). TFIID triggers pre-initiation complex formation, functions as a coactivator by interacting with transcriptional activators and reads epigenetic marks. TFIID is a megadalton-sized multiprotein complex composed of TATA-box-binding protein (TBP) and 13 TBP-associated factors (TAFs). Despite its crucial role, the detailed architecture and assembly mechanism of TFIID remain elusive. Histone fold domains are prevalent in TAFs, and histone-like tetramer and octamer structures have been proposed in TFIID. A functional core-TFIID subcomplex was revealed in Drosophila nuclei, consisting of a subset of TAFs (TAF4, TAF5, TAF6, TAF9 and TAF12). These core subunits are thought to be present in two copies in holo-TFIID, in contrast to TBP and other TAFs that are present in a single copy, conveying a transition from symmetry to asymmetry in the TFIID assembly pathway. Here we present the structure of human core-TFIID determined by cryo-electron microscopy at 11.6 {\AA} resolution. Our structure reveals a two-fold symmetric, interlaced architecture, with pronounced protrusions, that accommodates all conserved structural features of the TAFs including the histone folds. We further demonstrate that binding of one TAF8-TAF10 complex breaks the original symmetry of core-TFIID. We propose that the resulting asymmetric structure serves as a functional scaffold to nucleate holo-TFIID assembly, by accreting one copy each of the remaining TAFs and TBP.},

@article{Tsukihashi:2001aa,
	Abstract = {The general transcription factor TFIID has been shown to be involved in both core promoter recognition and the transcriptional activation of eukaryotic genes. We recently isolated TAF145 (one of TFIID subunits) temperature-sensitive mutants in yeast, in which transcription of the TUB2 gene is impaired at restrictive temperatures due to a defect in core promoter recognition. Here, we show in these mutants that the transcription of the RPS5 gene is impaired, mostly due to a defect in transcriptional activation rather than to a defect in core promoter recognition, although the latter is slightly affected as well. Surprisingly, the RPS5 core promoter can be activated by various activation domains fused to a GAL4 DNA binding domain, but not by the original upstream activating sequence (UAS) of the RPS5 gene. In addition, a heterologous CYC1 core promoter can be activated by RPS5-UAS at normal levels even in these mutants. These observations indicate that a distinct combination of core promoters and activators may exploit alternative activation pathways that vary in their requirement for TAF145 function. In addition, a particular function of TAF145 that is deleted in our mutants appears to be involved in both core promoter recognition and transcriptional activation.},

	Abstract = {TFIID is a multiprotein complex composed of TBP and several TAFIIs. Small amino-terminal segments (TAF N-terminal domain (TAND)) of Drosophila TAFII230 (dTAFII230) and yeast TAFII145 (yTAFII145) bind strongly to TBP and inhibit TBP-DNA interactions. yTAFII145 TAND (yTAND) was divided into two subdomains, yTANDI10-37 and yTANDII46-71, that function cooperatively. Here, we identify dTANDII within the amino terminus of dTAFII230 at 118-143 amino acids in addition to dTANDI18-77, reported previously. dTANDII exhibits pronounced sequence similarity to yTANDII, and the two were shown to be functionally equivalent in binding to TBP and inhibiting TBP-DNA interactions in vitro. Alanine scanning mutation analysis demonstrated that Phe-57 (yTANDII) and Tyr-129 (dTANDII) are critically required for the interaction with TBP. Yeast strains containing mutant yTAFII145 lacking yTANDI or yTANDII showed a temperature-sensitive growth phenotype. The conserved core of dTANDII could substitute for the yTANDII core, and Phe-57 or Tyr-129 described above was critically required for the function of this segment in promoting normal cell growth at 37 degreesC. In these respects, the impact of yTANDII mutations on cell growth paralleled their effects on TBP binding in vitro, strongly suggesting that the yTAFII145-TBP interaction and its negative effects on TFIID binding to core promoters are physiologically important.},

Here we present the crystal structure (1.97 {\AA}) and NMR analysis of yeast TAF1 N-terminal domains TAND1 and TAND2 bound to yeast TBP, together with mutational data. We find that yeast TAF1-TAND1, which in itself acts as a transcriptional activator, binds TBP's concave DNA-binding surface by presenting similar anchor residues to TBP as does Mot1 but from a distinct structural scaffold. Furthermore, we show how TAF1-TAND2 uses an aromatic and acidic anchoring pattern to bind a conserved TBP surface groove traversing the basic helix region, and we find highly similar TBP-binding motifs also presented by the structurally distinct TFIIA, Mot1 and Brf1 proteins. Our identification of these anchoring patterns, which can be easily disrupted or enhanced, provides insight into the competitive multiprotein TBP interplay critical to transcriptional regulation.},

The N-terminal region of the 230 kDa Drosophila TAF(II) (dTAF(II)230) binds directly to TBP and inhibits TBP binding to the TATA box. We report here the solution structure of the complex formed by dTAF(II)230 N-terminal region (residues 11-77) and TBP. dTAF(II)230(11-77) comprises three alpha helices and a beta hairpin, forming a core that occupies the concave DNA-binding surface of TBP. The TBP-binding surface of dTAF(II)230 markedly resembles the minor groove surface of the partially unwound TATA box in the TBP-TATA complex. This protein mimicry of the TATA element surface provides the structural basis of the mechanism by which dTAF(II)230 negatively controls the TATA box-binding activity within the TFIID complex.},

This element is recognized by TATA-binding protein (TBP), the central DNA-binding subunit of TFIID. In vitro binding and structural experiments indicate that TBP has a strong preference for TATA and induces severe DNA bending. Recent in vivo studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicate that TBP turnover is higher at TATA-containing than at TATA-less promoters; this turnover seems to be regulated by NC2 and Mot1p. We propose that bending of TATA by TBP acts in synergy with NC2 and Mot1p to release TBP more rapidly from TATA promoters in vivo, thus providing a rationale for the predominance of TATA boxes in highly regulated promoters versus constitutively active TATA-less promoters.},

The majority of nucleoplasmic TBP and other TFIID subunits associate with chromatin in a highly dynamic manner. TBP dynamics are regulated by the joint action of the SNF2-related BTAF1 protein and the NC2 complex. Strikingly, both BTAF1 and NC2 predominantly affect TBP dissociation rates, leaving the association rate unchanged. Chromatin immunoprecipitation shows that BTAF1 negatively regulates TBP and NC2 binding to active promoters. Our results support a model for a BTAF1-mediated release of TBP-NC2 complexes from chromatin.},

In this report, we demonstrate that the activation domain of E1A (CR3) specifically binds to two TAFs, human TAFII250 (hTAFII250) and Drosophila TAFII110 (dTAFII110). These interactions can take place both in vivo and in vitro and require the carboxy-terminal region of CR3; the zinc finger region of CR3, which binds TBP, is not needed to bind these TAFs. We mapped the E1A-binding sites on hTAFII250 to an internal region that contains a number of structural motifs, including an HMG box, a bromodomain, and direct repeats. This represents the first demonstration that hTAFII250 may serve as a target of a transcriptional activator. We also mapped the E1A binding on dTAFII110 to its C-terminal region. This is of significance since, by contrast, Sp1-mediated activation requires binding to the N-terminal domain of dTAFII110. Thus, distinct surfaces of dTAFII110 can serve as target sites for different activators. Our results indicate that E1A may activate transcription, in part, through direct contacts of the CR3 subdomains with selected components of the TFIID complex.},

	Abstract = {Whereas the human transcription factor IID generally interacts with only the TATA box element on most class II gene promoters, on certain promoters (e.g., the adenovirus 2 major late promoter) TFIID protects DNA sequences up to +35 base pairs downstream of the start site of transcription from DNase I cleavage. In this study, we show that Ad2 MLP sequences from -3 to +5 were sufficient to direct downstream promoter binding by TFIID when introduced into the human hsp70 gene promoter. These sequences correspond to the initiator transcription control element. Initiator mutations resulting in a loss of downstream binding demonstrated a diminished transcription efficiency in vitro. Likewise, initiator-dependent transcription stimulation required TFIID fractions capable of downstream promoter binding. Given the recent findings that immunopurified, human TFIID exhibited downstream promoter binding on the Ad2 MLP (Zhou, Q., Lieberman, P.M., Boyer, T.G. and Berk, A.J. (1992) Genes Dev. 6, 1964-1974), our data suggest that human TFIID can recognize the initiator element and that this interaction is required for maximally efficient transcription initiation.},

Recovery of basal and activated TFIID transcriptional specific activity was close to approximately 100%. Electrophoretic mobility-shift analysis demonstrated a single major DNA-protein complex. This holo-TFIID contains TAFs of approximately 250, 125, 95, 78, and 50 kD and sediments at 17S. Holo-TFIID produced an extended footprint over the adenovirus major late promoter TATA box and initiator sequence and supported transcriptional activation from a promoter lacking a TATA box. These results lead us to hypothesize that a single multisubunit TFIID protein supports transcriptional stimulation by diverse activation domains and from a TATA-less promoter.},

	Abstract = {Yeast TFIID comprises the TATA binding protein and 14 TBP-associated factors (TAF(II)s), nine of which contain histone-fold domains (HFDs). The C-terminal region of the TFIID-specific yTAF4 (yTAF(II)48) containing the HFD shares strong sequence similarity with Drosophila (d)TAF4 (dTAF(II)110) and human TAF4 (hTAF(II)135). A structure/function analysis of yTAF4 demonstrates that the HFD, a short conserved C-terminal domain (CCTD), and the region separating them are all required for yTAF4 function. Temperature-sensitive mutations in the yTAF4 HFD alpha2 helix or the CCTD can be suppressed upon overexpression of yTAF12 (yTAF(II)68). Moreover, coexpression in Escherichia coli indicates direct yTAF4-yTAF12 heterodimerization optimally requires both the yTAF4 HFD and CCTD. The x-ray crystal structure of the orthologous hTAF4-hTAF12 histone-like heterodimer indicates that the alpha3 region within the predicted TAF4 HFD is unstructured and does not correspond to the bona fide alpha3 helix. Our functional and biochemical analysis of yTAF4, rather provides strong evidence that the HFD alpha3 helix of the TAF4 family lies within the CCTD. These results reveal an unexpected and novel HFD organization in which the alpha3 helix is separated from the alpha2 helix by an extended loop containing a conserved functional domain.},

Toward this end, we first demonstrate that the multisubunit TFIID, SAGA, mediator, and Swi/Snf coactivator complexes from transcriptionally competent whole-cell yeast extracts were all capable of specifically interacting with the prototypic acidic ADs of Gal4 and VP16. We then used hexahistidine tags as genetically introduced activation domain-localized cross-linking receptors. In combination with immunological reagents against all subunits of TFIID and SAGA, we systematically identified the direct AD-interacting subunits within the AD-TFIID and AD-SAGA coactivator complexes enriched from whole-cell extracts and confirmed these results using purified TFIID and partially purified SAGA.

	Abstract = {The mechanisms of transcriptional activation directed by sequence-specific regulators is central to understanding gene regulation. Here, we report the isolation of coactivators responsible for mediating transcriptional activation by Gal4-Pro, a hybrid regulator containing the proline-rich activation domain of human CTF/NFI. Chromatographic studies indicate that endogenous human TFIID consists of a multisubunit complex containing the TATA-binding protein (TBP), coactivators, and other associated factors. A fraction containing the coactivator activity was separated from the endogenous TBP after disrupting the tightly associated complex with urea. The urea-purified TBP was active for basal level transcription but no longer could support activation by Gal4-Pro. However, when the two separated components were added together, activated levels of transcription were restored in the presence of Gal4-Pro. Immunoaffinity purification of the TFIID complex identifies several polypeptides specifically associated with the endogenous TBP, some or all of which function as coactivators when reconstituted with Gal4-Pro. The isolated coactivators also mediate activation by a chimeric glutamine-rich activator derived from Sp1 but not the Gal4-VP16 activator, suggesting distinct factor requirements for different types of transcriptional regulators.},

	Abstract = {Different mechanisms of transcriptional activation may be required for distinct classes of promoters and cellular conditions. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded transcriptional activator Zta recruits the general transcription factors IID (TFIID) and IIA (TFIIA) to promoter DNA and induces a TATA box-binding protein (TBP)-associated factor-dependent footprint downstream of the transcriptional initiation site. In this study, we investigated the functional significance of TFIID-TFIIA (D-A complex) recruitment by Zta. Alanine substitution mutations in the Zta activation domain which eliminate the ability of Zta to stimulate the D-A complex were examined. These Zta mutants were defective in the ability to activate transcription from an EBV-derived promoter (BHLF1) but activated a highly responsive synthetic promoter (Z7E4T). Both the number of activator binding sites and the core promoter region contribute to the requirement for D-A complex recruitment. These functionally distinct core promoters had significant differences in affinity for TBP and TFIID binding. The D-A complex-recruiting activity of Zta was found to be important for promoter selection in the presence of a competitor template. Conditions which limit TFIID binding to the TATA element or compromise the ability of TFIIA to bind TBP required activator stimulation of the D-A complex. These results indicate that D-A complex recruitment is one of at least two activation pathways utilized by Zta and is the essential pathway for a subset of promoters and conditions which limit TFIID binding to the TATA element.},

	Abstract = {We have previously shown that yeast TFIID provides coactivator function on the promoters of ribosomal protein-encoding genes (RPGs) by making direct contact with the transactivator repressor activator protein 1 (Rap1). Further, our structural studies of assemblies generated with purified Rap1, TFIID, and TFIIA on RPG enhancer-promoter DNA indicate that Rap1-TFIID interaction induces dramatic conformational rearrangements of enhancer-promoter DNA and TFIID-bound TFIIA. These data indicate a previously unknown yet critical role for yeast TFIIA in the integration of activator-TFIID contacts with promoter conformation and downstream preinitiation complex formation and/or function. Here we describe the use of systematic mutagenesis to define how specific TFIIA contacts contribute to these processes. We have verified that TFIIA is required for RPG transcription in vivo and in vitro, consistent with the existence of a critical Rap1-TFIIA-TFIID interaction network. We also identified essential points of contact for TFIIA and Rap1 within the Rap1 binding domain of the Taf4 subunit of TFIID. These data suggest a mechanism for how interactions between TFIID, TFIIA, and Rap1 contribute to the high rate of transcription initiation seen on RPGs in vivo.},

Here we employed immobilized template assays to correlate transcriptional activation with mediator and TFIID recruitment. In reactions reconstituted with purified proteins, we found that activator, TFIID, and mediator engage in reciprocal cooperative interactions to form a complex on promoter DNA. Preassembly of the coactivator complex accelerates the rate of transcription in a cell-free system depleted of TFIID and mediator. Our data argue that this coactivator complex is an intermediate in the assembly of an active transcription complex. Furthermore, the reciprocity of the interactions demonstrates that the complex could in principle be nucleated with either TFIID or mediator, implying that alternative pathways could be utilized to generate diversity in the way activators function in vivo.},

	Abstract = {We previously defined Saccharomyces cerevisiae TFIID as a 15-subunit complex comprised of the TATA binding protein (TBP) and 14 distinct TBP-associated factors (TAFs). In this report we give a detailed biochemical characterization of this general transcription factor. We have shown that yeast TFIID efficiently mediates both basal and activator-dependent transcription in vitro and displays TATA box binding activity that is functionally distinct from that of TBP. Analyses of the stoichiometry of TFIID subunits indicated that several TAFs are present at more than 1 copy per TFIID complex. This conclusion was further supported by coimmunoprecipitation experiments with a systematic family of (pseudo)diploid yeast strains that expressed epitope-tagged and untagged alleles of the genes encoding TFIID subunits. Based on these data, we calculated a native molecular mass for monomeric TFIID. Purified TFIID behaved in a fashion consistent with this calculated molecular mass in both gel filtration and rate-zonal sedimentation experiments. Quite surprisingly, although the TAF subunits of TFIID cofractionated as a single complex, TBP did not comigrate with the TAFs during either gel filtration chromatography or rate-zonal sedimentation, suggesting that TBP has the ability to dynamically associate with the TFIID TAFs. The results of direct biochemical exchange experiments confirmed this hypothesis. Together, our results represent a concise molecular characterization of the general transcription factor TFIID from S. cerevisiae.},

The structure of yeast TFIID, as determined by electron microscopy and digital image analysis, is formed by three lobes, labelled A-C, connected by thin linking domains. Immunomapping revealed that TFIID contains two copies of the WD-40 repeat-containing TAF5 and that TAF5 contributes to the linkers since its C- and N-termini were found in different lobes. This property was confirmed by the finding that a recombinant complex containing TAF5 complexed with six histone fold containing TAFs was able to form a trilobed structure. Moreover, the N-terminal domain of TAF1 was mapped in lobe C, whereas the histone acetyltransferase domain resides in lobe A along with TAF7. TBP was found in the linker domain between lobes A and C in a way that the N-terminal 100 residues of TAF1 are spanned over it.

We have found that purified recombinant Rap1p specifically interacts with purified TFIID in pull-down assays, and we have mapped the domains of Rap1p and subunits of TFIID responsible. In vitro transcription of a UAS(RAP1) enhancer-driven reporter gene requires both Rap1p and TFIID and is independent of the Fhl1p-Ifh1p coregulator. UAS(RAP1) enhancer-driven transactivation in extracts depleted of both Rap1p and TFIID is efficiently rescued by addition of physiological amounts of these two purified factors but not TATA-binding protein.

Structural studies using cryo-EM revealed that modular interactions underlie TFIID's ability to bind simultaneously multiple promoter motifs and to define a DNA state that will facilitate transcription initiation. Here we propose a general model of promoter binding by TFIID, where co-activators, activators, and histone modifications promote and/or stabilize a conformational state of TFIID that results in core promoter engagement. Within this high affinity conformation, we propose that TFIID's extensive interaction with promoter DNA leads to topological changes in the DNA that facilitate the eventual loading of RNAP II. While more work is required to dissect the individual contributions of activators and repressors to TFIID's DNA binding, the recent cryo-EM studies provide a physical framework to guide future structural, biophysical, and biochemical experiments.},

To provide structural insights into the DNA recognition step of transcription initiation, we used single-particle electron microscopy (EM) to visualize human TFIID with promoter DNA. This analysis revealed that TFIID coexists in two predominant and distinct structural states that differ by a 100 {\AA} translocation of TFIID's lobe A. The transition between these structural states is modulated by TFIIA, as the presence of TFIIA and promoter DNA facilitates the formation of a rearranged state of TFIID that enables promoter recognition and binding. DNA labeling and footprinting, together with cryo-EM studies, were used to map the locations of TATA, Initiator (Inr), motif ten element (MTE), and downstream core promoter element (DPE) promoter motifs within the TFIID-TFIIA-DNA structure. The existence of two structurally and functionally distinct forms of TFIID suggests that the different conformers may serve as specific targets for the action of regulatory factors.},

Analysis of the final elution by mass spectrometry confirms the presence of all the known TAFs and TBP, as well as Rsp5, Bul1, Ubp3, Bre5, Cka1, and Cka2. Both Taf1 and Taf5 are ubiquitinated, and the ubiquitination pattern of TFIID changes when BUL1 or BRE5 is deleted. Purified TFIID binds specifically to promoter DNA in a manner stabilized by TFIIA, and these complexes can be analyzed by native gel electrophoresis. Phenanthroline-copper footprinting and photoaffinity cross-linking indicate that TFIID makes extensive contacts upstream and downstream of the TATA box. TFIID supports basal transcription and activated transcription, both of which are enhanced by TFIIA.},

@article{Sugihara:2011aa,
	Abstract = {In eukaryotes, protein-coding genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (pol II) together with general transcription factors (GTFs). TFIID, the largest GTF composed of TATA element-binding protein (TBP) and 14 TBP-associated factors (TAFs), plays a critical role in transcription from TATA-less promoters. In metazoans, several core promoter elements other than the TATA element are thought to be recognition sites for TFIID. However, it is unclear whether functionally homologous elements also exist in TATA-less promoters in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we identify the cis-elements required to support normal levels of transcription and accurate initiation from sites within the TATA-less and TFIID-dependent RPS5 core promoter. Systematic mutational analyses show that multiple AT-rich sequences are required for these activities and appear to function as recognition sites for TFIID. A single copy of these sequences can support accurate initiation from the endogenous promoter, indicating that they carry highly redundant functions. These results show a novel architecture of yeast TATA-less promoters and support a model in which pol II scans DNA downstream from a recruited site, while searching for appropriate initiation site(s).},

	Abstract = {The cap-binding complex (CBC) binds to the cap structure of mRNA to protect it from exonucleases as well as to regulate downstream post-transcriptional events, translational initiation and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. However, its role in regulation of the upstream transcriptional events such as initiation or elongation remains unknown. Here, using a formaldehyde-based in vivo cross-linking and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay in conjunction with transcriptional, mutational and co-immunoprecipitational analyses, we show that CBC is recruited to the body of yeast gene, and then stimulates the formation of pre-initiation complex (PIC) at several yeast promoters through its interaction with Mot1p (modifier of transcription). Mot1p is recruited to these promoters, and enhances the PIC formation. We find that CBC promotes the recruitment of Mot1p which subsequently stimulates PIC formation at these promoters. Furthermore, the formation of PIC is essential for recruitment of CBC. Thus, our study presents an interesting observation that an mRNA binding factor exhibits a reciprocal synergistic effect on formation of PIC (and hence transcriptional initiation) at the promoter, revealing a new pathway of eukaryotic gene regulation in vivo.},

@article{Bhaumik:2011aa,
	Abstract = {A growing number of human diseases are linked to abnormal gene expression which is largely controlled at the level of transcriptional initiation. The gene-specific activator promotes the initiation of transcription through its interaction with one or more components of the transcriptional initiation machinery, hence leading to stimulated transcriptional initiation or activation. However, all activator proteins do not target the same component(s) of the transcriptional initiation machinery. Rather, they can have different target specificities, and thus, can lead to distinct mechanisms of transcriptional activation. Two such distinct mechanisms of transcriptional activation in yeast are mediated by the SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5-Acetyltransferase) and TFIID (Transcription factor IID) complexes, and are termed as "SAGA-dependent" and "TFIID-dependent" transcriptional activation, respectively. SAGA is the target of the activator in case of SAGA-dependent transcriptional activation, while the targeting of TFIID by the activator leads to TFIID-dependent transcriptional activation. Both the SAGA and TFIID complexes are highly conserved from yeast to human, and play crucial roles in gene activation among eukaryotes. The regulatory mechanisms of eukaryotic transcriptional activation by SAGA and TFIID are discussed here.

	Abstract = {Genome-wide binding preferences of the key components of eukaryotic preinitiation complex (PIC) have been recently measured at high resolution in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by Rhee and Pugh. However, the rules determining the PIC binding specificity remain poorly understood. In this study, we show that nonconsensus protein-DNA binding significantly influences PIC binding preferences. We estimate that such nonconsensus binding contributes statistically at least 2-3 kcal/mol (on average) of additional attractive free energy per protein per core-promoter region. The predicted attractive effect is particularly strong at repeated poly(dA:dT) and poly(dC:dG) tracts. Overall, the computed free-energy landscape of nonconsensus protein-DNA binding shows strong correlation with the measured genome-wide PIC occupancy. Remarkably, statistical PIC preferences of binding to both TFIID-dominated and SAGA-dominated genes correlate with the nonconsensus free-energy landscape, yet these two groups of genes are distinguishable based on the average free-energy profiles. We suggest that the predicted nonconsensus binding mechanism provides a genome-wide background for specific promoter elements, such as transcription-factor binding sites, TATA-like elements, and specific binding of the PIC components to nucleosomes. We also show that nonconsensus binding has genome-wide influence on transcriptional frequency.},

	Abstract = {Recent experiments provide an unprecedented view of protein-DNA binding in yeast and human genomes at single-nucleotide resolution. These measurements, performed over large cell populations, show quite generally that sequence-specific transcription regulators with well-defined protein-DNA consensus motifs bind only a fraction among all consensus motifs present in the genome. Alternatively, proteins in vivo often bind DNA regions lacking known consensus sequences. The rules determining whether a consensus motif is functional remain incompletely understood. Here we predict that genomic background surrounding specific protein-DNA binding motifs statistically modulates the binding of sequence-specific transcription regulators to these motifs. In particular, we show that nonconsensus protein-DNA binding in yeast is statistically enhanced, on average, around functional Reb1 motifs that are bound as compared to nonfunctional Reb1 motifs that are unbound. The landscape of nonconsensus protein-DNA binding around functional CTCF motifs in human demonstrates a more complex behavior. In particular, human genomic regions characterized by the highest CTCF occupancy, show statistically reduced level of nonconsensus protein-DNA binding. Our findings suggest that nonconsensus protein-DNA binding is fine-tuned around functional binding sites using a variety of design strategies.},

	Abstract = {Protein ubiquitylation is involved in the regulation of virtually all aspects of eukaryotic cell biology, including gene expression. The central function of E3 ubiquitin ligases in target selection is well established. More recently, it has become appreciated that deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs) are crucial components of ubiquitin-regulated cellular switches. Here, we discuss advances in our understanding of how DUBs regulate chromatin dynamics and gene expression. DUBs are integral components of the transcription machinery, involved in both gene activation and repression. They modulate the ubiquitylation status of histones H2A and H2B, which play pivotal roles in a cascade of molecular events that determine chromatin status. A DUB module in the SAGA coactivator complex is required for gene activation, whereas other DUBs are part of the Polycomb gene-silencing machinery. DUBs also control the level or subcellular compartmentalization of selective transcription factors, including the tumour suppressor p53. Typically, DUB specificity and activity are defined by its partner proteins, enabling remarkably versatile and sophisticated regulation. Recent findings not only underscore the pervasive and pivotal role of DUBs in gene expression control, but also raise paradoxical questions concerning the molecular mechanisms involved.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Spt7 is an integral component of the multi-subunit SAGA complex that is required for the expression of approximately 10% of yeast genes. Two forms of Spt7 have been identified, the second of which is truncated at its C-terminus and found in the SAGA-like (SLIK) complex.
RESULTS: We have found that C-terminal processing of Spt7 to its SLIK form (Spt7SLIK) and to a distinct third form (Spt7Form3) occurs in the absence of the SAGA complex components Gcn5, Spt8, Ada1 and Spt20, the latter two of which are required for the integrity of the complex. In addition, N-terminally truncated derivatives of Spt7, including a derivative lacking the histone fold, are processed, indicating that the C-terminus of Spt7 is sufficient for processing and that processing does not require functional Spt7. Using galactose inducible Spt7 expression, we show that the three forms of Spt7 appear and disappear at approximately the same rate with full-length Spt7 not being chased into Spt7SLIK or Spt7Form3. Interestingly, reduced levels of Spt7SLIK and Spt7Form3 were observed in a strain lacking the SAGA component Ubp8, suggesting a regulatory role for Ubp8 in the truncation of Spt7.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that truncation of Spt7 occurs early in the biosynthesis of distinct Spt7 containing complexes rather than being a dynamic process linked to the action of the SAGA complex in transcriptional regulation.},

The yeast Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex requires the coactivator protein Gcn5 for HAT activity. Identification of protein subunits by mass spectrometry and immunoblotting revealed that the TATA binding protein-associated factors (TAF(II)s) TAF(II)90, -68/61, -60, -25/23, and -20/17 are integral components of this complex. In addition, TAF(II)68 was required for both SAGA-dependent nucleosomal HAT activity and transcriptional activation from chromatin templates in vitro.

Using hierarchical cluster analysis of mass spectrometry data to identify proteins that copurify with components of the budding yeast TFIID transcription complex, we discovered that an uncharacterized protein corresponding to the YPL047W open reading frame significantly associated with shared components of the TFIID and SAGA complexes. Using mass spectrometry and biochemical assays, we show that YPL047W (SGF11, 11-kDa SAGA-associated factor) is an integral subunit of SAGA. However, SGF11 does not appear to play a role in SAGA-mediated histone acetylation. DNA microarray analysis showed that SGF11 mediates transcription of a subset of SAGA-dependent genes, as well as SAGA-independent genes. SAGA purified from a sgf11 Delta deletion strain has reduced amounts of Ubp8p, and a ubp8 Delta deletion strain shows changes in transcription similar to those seen with the sgf11 Delta deletion strain. Together, these data show that Sgf11p is a novel component of the yeast SAGA complex and that SGF11 regulates transcription of a subset of SAGA-regulated genes. Our data suggest that the role of SGF11 in transcription is independent of SAGA's histone acetyltransferase activity but may involve Ubp8p recruitment to or stabilization in SAGA.},

	Abstract = {The TATA-binding protein (TBP) plays a central role in assembling eukaryotic transcription complexes and is subjected to extensive regulation including auto-inhibition of its DNA binding activity through dimerization. Previously, we have shown that mutations that disrupt TBP dimers in vitro have three detectable phenotypes in vivo, including decreased steady-state levels of the mutants, transcriptional derepression, and toxicity toward cell growth. In an effort to more precisely define the multimeric structure of TBP in vivo, the crystallographic dimer structure was used to design mutations that might enhance dimer stability. These mutations were found to enhance dimer stability in vitro and significantly suppress in vivo phenotypes arising from a dimer-destabilizing mutation. Although it is conceivable that phenotypes associated with dimer-destabilizing mutants could arise through defective interactions with other cellular factors, intragenic suppression of these phenotypes by mutations designed to stabilize dimers provides compelling evidence for a crystallographic dimer configuration in vivo.},

When TBP is not bound to promoters, it sequesters its DNA binding domain through dimerization. Promoter assembly factors therefore might be required to dissociate TBP into productively binding monomers. Here we show that Saccharomyces cerevisiae Brf1 induces TBP dimers to dissociate. The high affinity TBP binding domain of Brf1 is not sufficient to promote TBP dimer dissociation but in addition requires the TFIIB homology domain of Brf1. A model is proposed to explain how two distinct functional domains of Brf1 work in concert to dissociate TBP into monomers.},

	Abstract = {Organisms respond to heat stress by reprogramming gene expression. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, heat-induced genes tend to be regulated by factors that belong to the Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase (SAGA) transcription regulatory pathway, whereas heat-repressed genes tend to be regulated by a parallel pathway involving transcription factor IID (TFIID). Here, we examine whether heat stress affects the occupancy of representative factors of each pathway at promoter regions throughout the yeast genome. Representatives of the SAGA pathway include the TATA binding protein, Spt3, and Mot1. Representatives of the TFIID pathway include the TATA binding protein, TAF1, and Bdf1. We find that heat stress causes disassembly of the TFIID pathway at genes that are inhibited by stress. In contrast, heat induces assembly of the SAGA pathway at stress-induced genes, although many also assemble along the TFIID pathway. Other genes were found to assemble almost exclusively along the TFIID pathway. Strikingly, these genes are lowly transcribed and are generally not induced. Thus, heat stress leads to factor assembly along each pathway but with distinct transcriptional outcomes. Further investigation of these pathways reveals that Bdf1 and Mot1 negatively regulate the SAGA pathway in different ways. The findings suggest that Bdf1 blocks assembly, whereas Mot1 promotes disassembly of the transcription machinery.},

	Abstract = {Transcription factor IID (TFIID) plays a central role in regulating the expression of most eukaryotic genes. Of the 14 TBP-associated factor (TAF) subunits that compose TFIID, TAF1 is one of the largest and most functionally diverse. Yeast TAF1 can be divided into four regions including a putative histone acetyltransferase domain and TBP, TAF, and promoter binding domains. Establishing the importance of each region in gene expression through deletion analysis has been hampered by the cellular requirement of TAF1 for viability. To circumvent this limitation we introduced galactose-inducible deletion derivatives of previously defined functional regions of TAF1 into a temperature-sensitive taf1ts2 yeast strain. After galactose induction of the TAF1 mutants and temperature-induced elimination of the resident Taf1ts2 protein, we examined the properties and phenotypes of the mutants, including their impact on genome-wide transcription. Virtually all TAF1-dependent genes, which comprise approximately 90% of the yeast genome, displayed a strong dependence upon all regions of TAF1 that were tested. This finding might reflect the need for each region of TAF1 to stabilize TAF1 against degradation or may indicate that all TAF1-dependent genes require the many activities of TAF1. Paradoxically, deletion of the region of TAF1 that is important for promoter binding interfered with the expression of many genes that are normally TFIID-independent/SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase)-dominated, suggesting that this region normally prevents TAF1 (TFIID) from interfering with the expression of SAGA-regulated genes.},

	Abstract = {Histone acetylation regulates gene expression, yet the functional contributions of the numerous histone acetyltransferases (HATs) to gene expression and their relationships with each other remain largely unexplored. The central role of the putative HAT-containing TAF1 subunit of TFIID in gene expression raises the fundamental question as to what extent, if any, TAF1 contributes to acetylation in vivo and to what extent it is redundant with other HATs. Our findings herein do not support the basic tenet that TAF1 is a major HAT in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, nor do we find that TAF1 is functionally redundant with other HATs, including Gcn5, Elp3, Hat1, Hpa2, Sas3, and Esa1, which is in contrast to previous conclusions regarding Gcn5. Our findings do reveal that of these HATs, only Gcn5 and Esa1 contribute substantially to gene expression genome wide. Interestingly, histone acetylation at promoter regions throughout the genome does not require TAF1 or RNA polymerase II, indicating that most acetylation is likely to precede transcription and not depend upon it. TAF1 function has been linked to Bdf1, which binds TFIID and acetylated histone H4 tails, but no linkage between TAF1 and the H4 HAT Esa1 has been established. Here, we present evidence for such a linkage through Bdf1.},

Here we examine the genome-wide location of representative members of these groups and their redistribution when the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome is reprogrammed by heat shock. As expected, assembly of active transcription complexes is coupled to eviction of H2A.Z nucleosomes, and disassembly is coupled to the return of nucleosomes. Remarkably, a large number of promoters assemble into partial preinitiation complexes (partial PICs), containing TFIIA, TFIID (and/or SAGA), TFIIB, TFIIE, and TFIIF. However, RNA polymerase II and TFIIH are generally not recruited, and nucleosomes are not displaced. These promoters may be preparing for additional stress that naturally accompany heat stress. For example, we find that oxidative stress, which often occurs with prolonged exposure of cells to high temperature, converts partial PICs into full PICs. Partial PICs therefore represent novel regulated intermediates that assemble at promoters in the midst of chromatin.},

Here we use comparative genomics to report a genome-wide map of nucleosome positioning sequences (NPSs) located in the vicinity of all Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes. We find that the underlying DNA sequence provides a very good predictor of nucleosome locations that have been experimentally mapped to a small fraction of the genome. Notably, distinct classes of genes possess characteristic arrangements of NPSs that may be important for their regulation. In particular, genes that have a relatively compact NPS arrangement over the promoter region tend to have a TATA box buried in an NPS and tend to be highly regulated by chromatin modifying and remodeling factors.},

Access to genetic information encoded in chromosomes is dependent on the position of nucleosomes along the DNA. Alternative locations just a few nucleotides apart can have profound effects on gene expression. Yet the nucleosomal context in which chromosomal and gene regulatory elements reside remains ill-defined on a genomic scale. Here we sequence the DNA of 322,000 individual Saccharomyces cerevisiae nucleosomes, containing the histone variant H2A.Z, to provide a comprehensive map of H2A.Z nucleosomes in functionally important regions. With a median 4-base-pair resolution, we identify new and established signatures of nucleosome positioning. A single predominant rotational setting and multiple translational settings are evident. Chromosomal elements, ranging from telomeres to centromeres and transcriptional units, are found to possess characteristic nucleosomal architecture that may be important for their function. Promoter regulatory elements, including transcription factor binding sites and transcriptional start sites, show topological relationships with nucleosomes, such that transcription factor binding sites tend to be rotationally exposed on the nucleosome surface near its border. Transcriptional start sites tended to reside about one helical turn inside the nucleosome border.

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Eukaryotic genes are controlled by proteins that assemble stepwise into a transcription complex. How the individual biochemically defined assembly steps are coordinated and applied throughout a genome is largely unknown. Here, we model and experimentally test a portion of the assembly process involving the regulation of the TATA binding protein (TBP) throughout the yeast genome.
RESULTS: Biochemical knowledge was used to formulate a series of coupled TBP regulatory reactions involving TFIID, SAGA, NC2, Mot1, and promoter DNA. The reactions were then linked to basic segments of the transcription cycle and modeled computationally. A single framework was employed, allowing the contribution of specific steps to vary from gene to gene. Promoter binding and transcriptional output were measured genome-wide using ChIP-chip and expression microarray assays. Mutagenesis was used to test the framework by shutting down specific parts of the network.
CONCLUSION: The model accounts for the regulation of TBP at most transcriptionally active promoters and provides a conceptual tool for interpreting genome-wide data sets. The findings further demonstrate the interconnections of TBP regulation on a genome-wide scale.},

	Abstract = {Two of the major histone acetyltransferases in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are NuA4 and SAGA, which acetylate histones H4 and H3, respectively. Acetylated H3 and H4 tails have been implicated in binding bromodomain proteins, including Bdf1. Bdf1 interacts with the general transcription factor TFIID, which might promote preinitiation complex (PIC) assembly. Bdf1 also interacts with the SWR complex (SWR-C). SWR-C is responsible for the deposition of the histone H2A variant H2A.Z. The placement of these interactions into a connected pathway of PIC assembly has not been fully established. Moreover, it is not known how widespread and how variable such a pathway might be on a genomic scale. Here we provide genomic evidence for S. cerevisiae that PIC assembly (TFIID occupancy) and chromatin remodeling (SWR-C and H2A.Z occupancy) are linked in large part to NuA4-directed H4 acetylation and subsequent Bdf1 binding, rather than through SAGA-directed H3 acetylation. Bdf1 and its homolog Bdf2 tend to have distinct locations in the genome. However, the deletion of BDF1 leads to the accumulation of Bdf2 at Bdf1-vacated sites. Thus, while Bdf1 and Bdf2 are at least partially redundant in function, their functions in the genome are geographically distinct.},

NELF causes Pol II to pause in the promoter-proximal region of the hsp70 gene in Drosophila melanogaster. In this study, genome-wide location analysis (chromatin immunoprecipitation-microarray chip [ChIP-chip] analysis) revealed that NELF is concentrated at the 5' ends of 2,111 genes in Drosophila cells. Permanganate genomic footprinting was used to determine if paused Pol II colocalized with NELF. Forty-six of 56 genes with NELF were found to have paused Pol II. Pol II pauses 30 to 50 nucleotides downstream from transcription start sites. Analysis of DNA sequences in the vicinity of paused Pol II identified a conserved DNA sequence that probably associates with TFIID but detected no evidence of RNA secondary structures or other conserved sequences that might directly control elongation. ChIP-chip experiments indicate that GAGA factor associates with 39% of the genes that have NELF. Surprisingly, NELF associates with almost one-half of the most highly expressed genes, indicating that NELF is not necessarily a repressor of gene expression. NELF-associated pausing of Pol II might be an obligatory but sometimes transient checkpoint during the transcription cycle.},

Here we produce a high-resolution reference map of H2A.Z and bulk nucleosome locations across the genome of the fly Drosophila melanogaster and compare it to that from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Like Saccharomyces, Drosophila nucleosomes are organized around active transcription start sites in a canonical -1, nucleosome-free region, +1 arrangement. However, Drosophila does not incorporate H2A.Z into the -1 nucleosome and does not bury its transcriptional start site in the +1 nucleosome. At thousands of genes, RNA polymerase II engages the +1 nucleosome and pauses. How the transcription initiation machinery contends with the +1 nucleosome seems to be fundamentally different across major eukaryotic lines.},

Peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4/PADI4) counteracts the functions of protein Arg methyltransferases in gene regulation by deimination and demethylimination. Here we show that the expression of a tumor suppressor gene, OKL38, is activated by the inhibition of PAD4 or the activation of p53 following DNA damage. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed a dynamic change of p53 and PAD4 occupancy and histone Arg modifications at the OKL38 promoter during DNA damage, suggesting a direct role of PAD4 and p53 in the expression of OKL38. Furthermore, we found that OKL38 induces apoptosis through localization to mitochondria and induction of cytochrome c release. Together, our studies identify OKL38 as a novel p53 target gene that is regulated by PAD4 and plays a role in apoptosis.},

	Abstract = {Most nucleosomes are well-organized at the 5' ends of S. cerevisiae genes where "-1" and "+1" nucleosomes bracket a nucleosome-free promoter region (NFR). How nucleosomal organization is specified by the genome is less clear. Here we establish and inter-relate rules governing genomic nucleosome organization by sequencing DNA from more than one million immunopurified S. cerevisiae nucleosomes (displayed at http://atlas.bx.psu.edu/). Evidence is presented that the organization of nucleosomes throughout genes is largely a consequence of statistical packing principles. The genomic sequence specifies the location of the -1 and +1 nucleosomes. The +1 nucleosome forms a barrier against which nucleosomes are packed, resulting in uniform positioning, which decays at farther distances from the barrier. We present evidence for a novel 3' NFR that is present at >95% of all genes. 3' NFRs may be important for transcription termination and anti-sense initiation. We present a high-resolution genome-wide map of TFIIB locations that implicates 3' NFRs in gene looping.},

Transcriptional regulators are represented as external pressure heads that determine flow rate. Modelling mutations in regulatory proteins is achieved by adjusting valves' on/off settings. The topology of the lattice is designed by the experimentalist to resemble the expected interconnection between the modelled agents and their influence on mRNA expression. Users can compare multiple lattice configurations so as to find the one that minimizes the error with experimental data.

	Abstract = {The predominant organizational theme by which the transcription machinery and chromatin regulators are positioned within promoter regions or throughout genes in a genome is largely unknown. We mapped the genomic location of diverse representative components of the gene regulatory machinery in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to an experimental resolution of <40 bp. Sequence-specific gene regulators, chromatin regulators, mediator, and RNA polymerase (Pol) II were found primarily near the downstream border from the "-1" nucleosome, which abuts against the approximately 140-bp nucleosome-free promoter region (NFR). General transcription factors TFIIA, -B, -D, -E, -F, -H were located near the downstream edge from the NFR. The -1 nucleosome dissociated upon Pol II recruitment, but not upon recruitment of only TBP and TFIIB. The position of many sequence-specific regulators in promoter regions correlated with the position of specific remodeling complexes, potentially reflecting functional interactions. Taken together the findings suggest that the combined action of activators and chromatin remodeling complexes remove the -1 nucleosome after the preinitiation complex (PIC) has partially assembled, but before or concomitant with Pol II recruitment. We find PIC assembly, which includes Pol II recruitment, to be a significant rate-limiting step during transcription, but that additional gene-specific rate-limiting steps associated with Pol II occur after recruitment.},

Whether gene regulatory proteins that interact with nucleosomes are selective for individual nucleosome positions across the genome is not known. Here, we examine on a genomic scale several protein-nucleosome interactions, including those that (1) bind histones (Bdf1/SWR1 and Srm1), (2) bind specific DNA sequences (Rap1 and Reb1), and (3) potentially collide with nucleosomes during transcription (RNA polymerase II). We find that the Bdf1/SWR1 complex forms a dinucleosome complex that is selective for the +1 and +2 nucleosomes of active genes. Rap1 selectively binds to its cognate site on the rotationally exposed first and second helical turn of nucleosomal DNA. We find that a transcribing RNA polymerase creates a delocalized state of resident nucleosomes. These findings suggest that nucleosomes around promoter regions have position-specific functions and that some gene regulators have position-specific nucleosomal interactions.},

Studies based on mitochondrial and small sets of nuclear markers have shown that these hunter-gatherers, known as Khoisan, San, or Bushmen, are genetically divergent from other humans. However, until now, fully sequenced human genomes have been limited to recently diverged populations. Here we present the complete genome sequences of an indigenous hunter-gatherer from the Kalahari Desert and a Bantu from southern Africa, as well as protein-coding regions from an additional three hunter-gatherers from disparate regions of the Kalahari. We characterize the extent of whole-genome and exome diversity among the five men, reporting 1.3 million novel DNA differences genome-wide, including 13,146 novel amino acid variants. In terms of nucleotide substitutions, the Bushmen seem to be, on average, more different from each other than, for example, a European and an Asian. Observed genomic differences between the hunter-gatherers and others may help to pinpoint genetic adaptations to an agricultural lifestyle. Adding the described variants to current databases will facilitate inclusion of southern Africans in medical research efforts, particularly when family and medical histories can be correlated with genome-wide data.},

	Abstract = {Apparent occupancy levels of proteins bound to DNA in vivo can now be routinely measured on a genomic scale. A challenge in relating these occupancy levels to assembly mechanisms that are defined with biochemically isolated components lies in the veracity of assumptions made regarding the in vivo system. Assumptions regarding behavior of molecules in vivo can neither be proven true nor false, and thus is necessarily subjective. Nevertheless, within those confines, connecting in vivo protein-DNA interaction observations with defined biochemical mechanisms is an important step towards fully defining and understanding assembly/disassembly mechanisms in vivo. To this end, we have developed a computational program PathCom that models in vivo protein-DNA occupancy data as biochemical mechanisms under the assumption that occupancy levels can be related to binding duration and explicitly defined assembly/disassembly reactions. We exemplify the process with the assembly of the general transcription factors (TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, TFIIH, and RNA polymerase II) at the genes of the budding yeast Saccharomyces. Within the assumption inherent in the system our modeling suggests that TBP occupancy at promoters is rather transient compared to other general factors, despite the importance of TBP in nucleating assembly of the preinitiation complex. PathCom is suitable for modeling any assembly/disassembly pathway, given that all the proteins (or species) come together to form a complex.},

	Abstract = {Eukaryotic genes respond to their environment by changing the expression of selected genes. The question we address here is whether distinct transcriptional responses to different environmental signals elicit distinct modes of assembly of the transcription machinery. In particular, we examine transcription complex assembly by the stress-directed SAGA complex versus the housekeeping assembly factor TFIID. We focus on genomic responses to the DNA damaging agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) in comparison to responses to acute heat shock, looking at changes in genome-wide factor occupancy measured by chromatin immunoprecipitation-microchip (ChIP-chip) and ChIP-sequencing analyses. Our data suggest that MMS-induced genes undergo transcription complex assembly sequentially, first involving SAGA and then involving a slower TFIID recruitment, whereas heat shock genes utilize the SAGA and TFIID pathways rapidly and in parallel. Also Crt1, the repressor of model MMS-inducible ribonucleotide reductase genes, was found not to play a wider role in repression of DNA damage-inducible genes. Taken together, our findings reveal a distinct involvement of gene and chromatin regulatory factors in response to DNA damage versus heat shock and suggest different implementations of the SAGA and TFIID assembly pathways that may depend upon whether a sustained or transient change in gene expression ensues.},

This Primer explains the principles for mapping and analyzing the primary organization of chromatin on a genomic scale. After introducing chromatin organization and its impact on gene regulation and human health, we then describe methods that detect nucleosome positioning and occupancy levels using chromatin immunoprecipitation in combination with deep sequencing (ChIP-Seq), a strategy that is now straightforward and cost efficient. We then explore current strategies for converting the sequence information into knowledge about chromatin, an exciting challenge for biologists and bioinformaticians.},

	Abstract = {TATA binding protein (TBP) plays a central role in transcription complex assembly and is regulated by a variety of transcription factors, including Mot1. Mot1 is an essential protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that exerts both negative and positive effects on transcription via interactions with TBP. It contains two conserved regions important for TBP interactions, another conserved region that hydrolyzes ATP to remove TBP from DNA, and a fourth conserved region with unknown function. Whether these regions contribute equally to transcriptional regulation genome-wide is unknown. Here, we employ a transient-replacement assay using deletion derivatives in the conserved regions of Mot1 to investigate their contributions to gene regulation throughout the S. cerevisiae genome. These four regions of Mot1 are essential for growth and are generally required for all Mot1-regulated genes. Loss of the ATPase region, but not other conserved regions, caused TBP to redistribute away from a subset of Mot1-inhibited genes, leading to decreased expression of those genes. A corresponding increase in TBP occupancy and expression occurred at another set of genes that are normally Mot1 independent. The data suggest that Mot1 uses ATP hydrolysis to redistribute accessible TBP away from intrinsically preferred sites to other sites of intrinsically low preference.},

We generated genome-wide maps of individual nucleosome organizational states, including positions and occupancy of all nucleosomes, and H3K9 acetylation and H3K4, K36, K79 tri-methylation, during meiotic spore development (gametogenesis) in Saccharomyces. Nucleosome organization was remarkably constant as the genome underwent compaction. However, during an acute meiotic starvation response, nucleosomes were repositioned to alter the accessibility of select transcriptional start sites. Surprisingly, the majority of the meiotic programs did not use this nucleosome repositioning, but was dominated by antisense control. Histone modification states were also remarkably stable, being abundant at specific nucleosome positions at three-quarters of all genes, despite most genes being rarely transcribed. Our findings suggest that, during meiosis, the basic features of genomic chromatin organization are essentially a fixed property of chromosomes, but tweaked in a restricted and program-specific manner.},

Determinants of this and other aspects of genomic nucleosome organization have been ascribed to statistical positioning, intrinsically DNA-encoded positioning, or some aspect of transcription initiation. Here, we provide evidence for a different explanation. Biochemical reconstitution of proper nucleosome positioning, spacing, and occupancy levels was achieved across the 5' ends of most yeast genes by adenosine triphosphate-dependent trans-acting factors. These transcription-independent activities override DNA-intrinsic positioning and maintain uniform spacing at the 5' ends of genes even at low nucleosome densities. Thus, an active, nonstatistical nucleosome packing mechanism creates chromatin organizing centers at the 5' ends of genes where important regulatory elements reside.},

Mechanisms that control pausing are largely unknown. We developed permanganate-ChIP-seq to evaluate the state of Pol II at promoters throughout the Drosophila genome, and a biochemical system that reconstitutes promoter-proximal pausing to define pausing mechanisms. Stable open complexes of Pol II are largely absent from the transcription start sites of most mRNA genes but are present at snRNA genes and the highly transcribed heat shock genes following their induction. The location of the pause is influenced by the timing between when NELF loads onto Pol II and how fast Pol II escapes the promoter region. Our biochemical analysis reveals that the sequence-specific transcription factor, GAF, orchestrates efficient pausing by recruiting NELF to promoters before transcription initiation and by assisting in loading NELF onto Pol II after initiation.},

To study CTCF multivalency in vivo, we define ZF binding requirements at ∼50,000 genomic sites in primary lymphocytes. We find that CTCF reads sequence diversity through ZF clustering. ZFs 4-7 anchor CTCF to ∼80% of targets containing the core motif. Nonconserved flanking sequences are recognized by ZFs 1-2 and ZFs 8-11 clusters, which also stabilize CTCF broadly. Alternatively, ZFs 9-11 associate with a second phylogenetically conserved upstream motif at ∼15% of its sites. Individually, ZFs increase overall binding and chromatin residence time. Unexpectedly, we also uncovered a conserved downstream DNA motif that destabilizes CTCF occupancy. Thus, CTCF associates with a wide array of DNA modules via combinatorial clustering of its 11 ZFs.},

It is situated in a deep branch in the evolutionary tree and is particularly noteworthy in having a very A/T-rich genome. Dictyostelium provides an ideal system to examine the extreme to which nucleotide bias may be employed in organizing promoters, genes, and nucleosomes across a genome. We find that Dictyostelium genes are demarcated precisely at their 5' ends by poly-T tracts and precisely at their 3' ends by poly-A tracts. These tracts are also associated with nucleosome-free regions and are embedded with precisely positioned TATA boxes. Homo- and heteropolymeric tracts of A and T demarcate nucleosome border regions. Together, these findings reveal the presence of a variety of functionally distinct polymeric A/T elements. Strikingly, Dictyostelium chromatin may be organized in di-nucleosome units but is otherwise organized as in animals. This includes a +1 nucleosome in a position that predicts the presence of a paused RNA polymerase II. Indeed, we find a strong phylogenetic relationship between the presence of the NELF pausing factor and positioning of the +1 nucleosome. Pausing and +1 nucleosome positioning may have coevolved in animals.},

Its organization around euchromatin genes and other features have been described in many eukaryotic model organisms. However, less is known about H2Av nucleosome organization in heterochromatin. Here we report the properties and organization of individual H2Av nucleosomes around genes and transposable elements located in Drosophila heterochromatic regions.

Among the factors directing nucleosome positioning, the DNA sequence is highly important. Two main classes of nucleosome positioning sequence (NPS) patterns have previously been described. In the first class, AA, TT, and other WW dinucleotides (where W is A or T) tend to occur together (in-phase) in the major groove of DNA closest to the histone octamer surface, while SS dinucleotides (where S is G or C) are predominantly positioned in the major groove facing outward. In the second class, AA and TT are structurally separated (AA backbone near the histone octamer, and TT backbone further away), but grouped with other RR (where R is purine A or G) and YY (where Y is pyrimidine C or T) dinucleotides. As a result, the RR/YY pattern includes counter-phase AA/TT distributions. We describe here anti-NPS patterns, which are inverse to the conventional NPS patterns: WW runs inverse to SS, and RR inverse to YY. Evidence for the biological relevance of anti-NPS patterns is presented.},

The catalytic subunit of SWI/SNF has an ATP-dependent DNA translocase domain that is essential for remodeling. Besides the DNA translocase domain there are other domains in the catalytic subunit of SWI/SNF that have important roles in mobilizing nucleosomes. One of these domains, termed SnAC (Snf2 ATP Coupling), is conserved in all eukaryotic SWI/SNF complexes and is located between the ATPase and A-T hook domains. Here, we show that the SnAC domain is essential for SWI/SNF activity. The SnAC domain is not required for SWI/SNF complex integrity, efficient nucleosome binding, or recruitment by acidic transcription activators. The SnAC domain is however required in vivo for transcription regulation by SWI/SNF as seen by alternative carbon source growth assays, northern analysis, and genome-wide expression profiling. The ATPase and nucleosome mobilizing activities of SWI/SNF are severely affected when the SnAC domain is removed or mutated. The SnAC domain positively regulates the catalytic activity of the ATPase domain of SWI/SNF to hydrolyze ATP without significantly affecting its affinity for ATP.},

The contribution of histone modifications to genome-wide nucleosomal organization has not been systematically evaluated. In the present study, we examine the role of H2BK123 ubiquitylation, a key regulator of several histone modifications, on nucleosomal organization at promoter, genic, and transcription termination regions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using high-resolution MNase chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq), we map nucleosome positioning and occupancy in mutants of the H2BK123 ubiquitylation pathway. We found that H2B ubiquitylation-mediated nucleosome formation and/or stability inhibits the assembly of the transcription machinery at normally quiescent promoters, whereas ubiquitylation within highly active gene bodies promotes transcription elongation. This regulation does not proceed through ubiquitylation-regulated histone marks at H3K4, K36, and K79. Our findings suggest that mechanistically similar functions of H2B ubiquitylation (nucleosome assembly) elicit different functional outcomes on genes depending on its positional context in promoters (repressive) versus transcribed regions (activating).},

Bound locations are detectable as peak pairs by deep sequencing. Contaminating DNA is degraded or fails to form complementary peak pairs. With the single bp accuracy provided by ChIP-exo, we show an unprecedented view into genome-wide binding of the yeast transcription factors Reb1, Gal4, Phd1, Rap1, and human CTCF.

	Abstract = {Transcription and regulation of genes originate from transcription pre-initiation complexes (PICs). Their structural and positional organization across eukaryotic genomes is unknown. Here we applied lambda exonuclease to chromatin immunoprecipitates (termed ChIP-exo) to examine the precise location of 6,045 PICs in Saccharomyces. PICs, including RNA polymerase II and protein complexes TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID (or TBP), TFIIE, TFIIF, TFIIH and TFIIK were positioned within promoters and excluded from coding regions. Exonuclease patterns were in agreement with crystallographic models of the PIC, and were sufficiently precise to identify TATA-like elements at so-called TATA-less promoters. These PICs and their transcription start sites were positionally constrained at TFIID-engaged downstream +1 nucleosomes. At TATA-box-containing promoters, which are depleted of TFIID, a +1 nucleosome was positioned to be in competition with the PIC, which may allow greater latitude in start-site selection. Our genomic localization of messenger RNA and non-coding RNA PICs reveals that two PICs, in inverted orientation, may occupy the flanking borders of nucleosome-free regions. Their unambiguous detection may help distinguish bona fide genes from transcriptional noise.},

	Abstract = {Monoubiquitination of histone H2B on Lys 123 (H2BK123ub) is a transient histone modification considered to be essential for establishing H3K4 and H3K79 trimethylation by Set1/COMPASS and Dot1, respectively. Here, we identified Chd1 as a factor that is required for the maintenance of high levels of H2B monoubiquitination, but not for H3K4 and H3K79 trimethylation. Loss of Chd1 results in a substantial loss of H2BK123ub levels with little to no effect on the genome-wide pattern of H3K4 and H3K79 trimethylation. Our data show that nucleosomal occupancy is reduced in gene bodies in both chd1Δ and, as has been shown, K123A mutant backgrounds. We also demonstrated that Chd1's function in maintaining H2BK123ub levels is conserved from yeast to humans. Our study provides evidence that only small levels of H2BK123ub are necessary for full levels of H3K4 and H3K79 trimethylation in vivo and points to a possible role for Chd1 in positively regulating gene expression through promoting nucleosome reassembly coupled with H2B monoubiquitination.},

	Abstract = {The differentiation of gametes involves dramatic changes to chromatin, affecting transcription, meiosis, and cell morphology. Sporulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae shares many chromatin features with spermatogenesis, including a 10-fold compaction of the nucleus. To identify new proteins involved in spore nuclear organization, we purified chromatin from mature spores and discovered a significant enrichment of the linker histone (Hho1). The function of Hho1 has proven to be elusive during vegetative growth, but here we demonstrate its requirement for efficient sporulation and full compaction of the spore genome. Hho1 chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed increased genome-wide binding in mature spores and provides novel in vivo evidence of the linker histone binding to nucleosomal linker DNA. We also link Hho1 function to the transcription factor Ume6, the master repressor of early meiotic genes. Hho1 and Ume6 are depleted during meiosis, and analysis of published ChIP-chip data obtained during vegetative growth reveals a high binding correlation of both proteins at promoters of early meiotic genes. Moreover, Ume6 promotes binding of Hho1 to meiotic gene promoters. Thus, Hho1 may play a dual role during sporulation: Hho1 and Ume6 depletion facilitates the onset of meiosis via activation of Ume6-repressed early meiotic genes, whereas Hho1 enrichment in mature spores contributes to spore genome compaction.},

We determined the genome-wide binding of remodeler complexes SWI/SNF, RSC, ISW1a, ISW1b, ISW2, and INO80 to individual nucleosomes in Saccharomyces, and determined their functional contributions to nucleosome positioning through deletion analysis. We applied ultra-high-resolution ChIP-exo mapping to Isw2 to determine its subnucleosomal orientation and organization on a genomic scale. Remodelers interacted with selected nucleosome positions relative to the start and end of genes and produced net directionality in moving nucleosomes either away or toward nucleosome-free regions at the 5' and 3' ends of genes. Isw2 possessed a subnucleosomal organization in accord with biochemical and crystallographic-based models that place its linker binding region within promoters and abutted against Reb1-bound locations. Together, these findings reveal a coordinated position-specific approach taken by remodelers to organize genic nucleosomes into arrays.},

ChIP-exo allows identification of a nearly complete set of the binding locations of DNA-binding proteins at near-single-nucleotide resolution with almost no background. The process is initiated by cross-linking DNA and associated proteins. Chromatin is then isolated from nuclei and subjected to sonication. Subsequently, an antibody against the desired protein is used to immunoprecipitate specific DNA-protein complexes. ChIP DNA is purified, sequencing adaptors are ligated, and the adaptor-ligated DNA is then digested by lambda exonuclease, generating 25- to 50-nucleotide fragments for high-throughput sequencing. The sequences of the fragments are mapped back to the reference genome to determine the binding locations. The 5' ends of DNA fragments on the forward and reverse strands indicate the left and right boundaries of the DNA-protein binding regions, respectively.},

	Abstract = {SWR-C/SWR1 and INO80 are multisubunit complexes that catalyze the deposition and removal, respectively, of histone variant H2A.Z from the first nucleosome at the start of genes. How they target and engage these +1 nucleosomes is unclear. Using ChIP-exo, we identified the subnucleosomal placement of 20 of their subunits across the yeast genome. The Swc2 subunit of SWR-C bound a narrowly defined region in the adjacent nucleosome-free region (NFR), where it positioned the Swr1 subunit over one of two sites of H2A.Z deposition at +1. The genomic binding maps suggest that many subunits have a rather plastic organization that allows subunits to exchange between the two complexes. One outcome of promoting H2A/H2A.Z exchange was an enhanced turnover of entire nucleosomes, thereby creating dynamic chromatin at the start of genes. Our findings provide unifying concepts on how these two opposing chromatin remodeling complexes function selectively at the +1 nucleosome of nearly all genes.},

Here we address whether this non-coding transcription arises at promoters, and detail the interactions of initiation factors TATA box binding protein (TBP), transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) and RNA polymerase (Pol) II. Using ChIP-exo (chromatin immunoprecipitation with lambda exonuclease digestion followed by high-throughput sequencing), we identify approximately 160,000 transcription initiation complexes across the human K562 genome, and more in other cancer genomes. Only about 5% associate with messenger RNA genes. The remainder associates with non-polyadenylated non-coding transcription. Regardless, Pol II moves into a transcriptionally paused state, and TBP and TFIIB remain at the promoter. Remarkably, the vast majority of locations contain the four core promoter elements- upstream TFIIB recognition element (BREu), TATA, downstream TFIIB recognition element (BREd), and initiator element (INR)-in constrained positions. All but the INR also reside at Pol III promoters, where TBP makes similar contacts. This comprehensive and high-resolution genome-wide detection of the initiation machinery produces a consolidated view of transcription initiation events from yeast to humans at Pol II/III TATA-containing/TATA-less coding and non-coding genes.},

	Abstract = {General transcription factor TFIID, consisting of TATA-binding protein (TBP) and TBP-associated factors (TAFs), plays a central role in both positive and negative regulation of transcription. The TAF N-terminal domain (TAND) of TAF1 has been shown to interact with TBP and to modulate the interaction of TBP with the TATA box, which is required for transcriptional initiation and activation of TATA-promoter operated genes. We have previously demonstrated that the Drosophila TAND region of TAF1 (residues 11-77) undergoes an induced folding from a largely unstructured state to a globular structure that occupies the DNA-binding surface of TBP thereby inhibiting the DNA-binding activity of TBP. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the TAND region of TAF1 displays marked differences in the primary structure relative to Drosophila TAF1 (11% identity) yet possesses transcriptional activity both in vivo and in vitro. Here we present structural and functional studies of yeast TAND1 and TAND2 regions (residues 10-37, and 46-71, respectively). Our NMR data show that, in yeast, TAND1 contains two alpha-helices (residues 16-23, 30-36) and TAND2 forms a mini beta-sheet structure (residues 53-56, 61-64). These TAND1 and TAND2 structured regions interact with the concave and convex sides of the saddle-like structure of TBP, respectively. Present NMR, mutagenesis and genetic data together elucidate that the minimal region (TAND1 core) required for GAL4-dependent transcriptional activation corresponds to the first helix region of TAND1, while the functional core region of TAND2, involved in direct interaction with TBP convex alpha-helix 2, overlaps with the mini beta-sheet region.},

	Abstract = {Eukaryotes have three distinct RNA polymerases that catalyze transcription of nuclear genes. RNA polymerase II is responsible for transcribing nuclear genes encoding the messenger RNAs and several small nuclear RNAs. Like RNA polymerases I and III, pol II cannot recognize its target promoter directly and initiate transcription without accessory factors. Instead, this large multisubunit enzyme relies on both general transcription factors and transcriptional activators and coactivators to regulate transcription from class II promoters. At the center of this process is TFIID, a 700-kD complex composed of the TATA box binding protein (TBP) and a set of phylogenetically conserved, polymerase-specific TBP-associated factors or TAFIIS. Together, TBP and the TAFIIS direct assembly of the transcription machinery and play critical regulatory roles in eukaryotic gene expression.},

The amino-terminal portions of dTAFII42 and dTAFII62 from Drosophila adopt the canonical histone fold, consisting of two short alpha-helices flanking a long central alpha-helix. Like histones H3 and H4, dTAFII42 and dTAFII62 form an intimate heterodimer by extensive hydrophobic contacts between the paired molecules. In solution and in the crystalline state, the dTAFII42/dTAFII62 complex exists as a heterotetramer, resembling the (H3/H4)2 heterotetrameric core of the histone octamer, suggesting that TFIID contains a histone octamer-like substructure.},

Molecular studies of the multiprotein TFIID complex have identified a primary TATA binding subunit (TBP), TBP-associated factors (TAFs) that interact with and mediate the function of activators and intersubunit interactions but have yielded relatively little insight into the structural organization of the complex or the actual mechanism of transcriptional activation. Here we present biochemical evidence for the structural relevance of histone homologies in the human TFIID subunits hTAF80, hTAF31 and hTAF20/15. Together with analyses of native TFIID complexes and accompanying crystallographic studies, the results suggest that there is a histone octamer-like TAF complex within TFIID.},

	Abstract = {Transcription of the yeast GAL1 and GAL10 genes is induced by growth on galactose. Using the technique of photofootprinting in vivo, we previously documented equivalent transcription-dependent footprints within the putative "TATA" elements of both genes. To explore the functional significance of these observations, we created a 3-base-pair substitution mutation within the GAL1 promoter TATA element, which disrupted the ATATAA consensus sequence but left intact the photomodification targets. The mutation reduced galactose-induced RNA levels by a factor of 100. The mutant promoter no longer displayed the characteristic TATA sequence footprint, supporting the hypothesis that transcription activation involves the binding of a TATA box factor. We also observed a collection of transcription-correlated alterations in the modification pattern at sites between the UASG and the GAL1 TATA element, within sequences that are not required for inducible transcription. These patterns, characteristic of the induced wild-type GAL1 gene, were still galactose inducible with the TATA mutant GAl1 promoter, despite the low level of transcription from this promoter. We conclude that the GAL4-dependent protein/DNA structure responsible for the altered pattern within nonessential sequences is therefore not strictly coupled to an active TATA element or to high levels of expression. Nonetheless, the patterns probably reflect a stable protein-dependent structure that accompanies assembly of the transcription initiation complex.},

	Abstract = {In eukaryotes, transcriptional activators have been proposed to function by recruiting the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) machinery, by altering the conformation of this machinery, or by affecting steps after initiation, but the evidence is not definitive. Genomic footprinting of yeast TATA-box elements reveals activator-dependent alterations of chromatin structure and activator-independent protection, but little is known about the association of specific components of the Pol II machinery with promoters in vivo. Here we analyse TATA-box-binding-protein (TBP) occupancy of 30 yeast promoters in vivo. We find that TBP association with promoters is stimulated by activators and inhibited by the Cyc8-Tup1 repressor, and that transcriptional activity correlates strongly with the degree of TBP occupancy. In a small subset of promoters, TBP occupancy is higher than expected when gene activity is low, and the activator-dependent increase is modest. TBP association depends on the Pol II holoenzyme component Srb4, but not on the Kin28 subunit of the transcription factor TFIIH, even though both proteins are generally required for transcription. Thus in yeast cells, TBP association with promoters occurs in concert with the Pol II holoenzyme, activator-dependent recruitment of the Pol II machinery occurs at the vast majority of promoters, and Kin28 acts after the initial recruitment.},

	Abstract = {The human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) regulatory protein Tax activates transcription of the proviral long terminal repeats and a number of cellular promoters. We have developed an in vitro system to characterize the mechanism by which Tax interacts with the host cell transcription machinery. Tax was purified from cells infected with a baculovirus expression vector. Addition of these Tax preparations to nuclear extracts from uninfected human T lymphocytes activated transcription of the HTLV-I long terminal repeat approximately 10-fold. Transcription-stimulatory activity copurified with the immunoreactive 40-kDa Tax polypeptide on gel filtration chromatography, and, as expected, the effect of recombinant Tax was diminished in HTLV-I-infected T-lymphocyte extracts containing endogenous Tax. Tax-mediated transactivation in vivo has been previously shown to require 21-bp-repeat Tax-responsive elements (TxREs) in the promoter DNA. Stimulation of transcription in vitro was also strongly dependent on these sequences. To investigate the mechanism of Tax transactivation, cellular proteins that bind the 21-bp-repeat TxREs were prepared by DNA affinity chromatography. Recombinant Tax markedly increased the formation of a specific host protein-DNA complex detected in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. These data suggest that Tax activates transcription through a direct interaction with cellular proteins that bind to the 21-bp-repeat TxREs.},

Transcription also occurs from the opposite DNA strand in the dhfr 5' region, with a probable initiation site at approximately -195 relative to the dhfr translation start. A 4-kb polyadenylated RNA that is derived from the opposite-strand transcription increases threefold in abundance after serum starvation of CHO cells for 24 h. dhfr mRNA levels do not change during this time. The first dhfr exon lies within a 1-kb genomic region marked by exceptionally high G + C content and lack of DNA methylation. This region also includes a 214-base-pair (bp) exon for the opposite-strand transcript and five of the six DNase I-hypersensitive sites identified at the dhfr locus.

	Abstract = {The core promoter of eukaryotic genes is the minimal DNA region that recruits the basal transcription machinery to direct efficient and accurate transcription initiation. The fraction of human and yeast genes that contain specific core promoter elements such as the TATA box and the initiator (INR) remains unclear and core promoter motifs specific for TATA-less genes remain to be identified. Here, we present genome-scale computational analyses indicating that approximately 76% of human core promoters lack TATA-like elements, have a high GC content, and are enriched in Sp1-binding sites. We further identify two motifs - M3 (SCGGAAGY) and M22 (TGCGCANK) - that occur preferentially in human TATA-less core promoters. About 24% of human genes have a TATA-like element and their promoters are generally AT-rich; however, only approximately 10% of these TATA-containing promoters have the canonical TATA box (TATAWAWR). In contrast, approximately 46% of human core promoters contain the consensus INR (YYANWYY) and approximately 30% are INR-containing TATA-less genes. Significantly, approximately 46% of human promoters lack both TATA-like and consensus INR elements. Surprisingly, mammalian-type INR sequences are present - and tend to cluster - in the transcription start site (TSS) region of approximately 40% of yeast core promoters and the frequency of specific core promoter types appears to be conserved in yeast and human genomes. Gene Ontology analyses reveal that TATA-less genes in humans, as in yeast, are frequently involved in basic "housekeeping" processes, while TATA-containing genes are more often highly regulated, such as by biotic or stress stimuli. These results reveal unexpected similarities in the occurrence of specific core promoter types and in their associated biological processes in yeast and humans and point to novel vertebrate-specific DNA motifs that might play a selective role in TATA-independent transcription.},

	Abstract = {Promoter Classifier is a package of seven stand-alone Windows-based C++ programs allowing the following basic manipulations with a set of promoter sequences: (i) calculation of positional distributions of nucleotides averaged over all promoters of the dataset; (ii) calculation of the averaged occurrence frequencies of the transcription factor binding sites and their combinations; (iii) division of the dataset into subsets of sequences containing or lacking certain promoter elements or combinations; (iv) extraction of the promoter subsets containing or lacking CpG islands around the transcription start site; and (v) calculation of spatial distributions of the promoter DNA stacking energy and bending stiffness. All programs have a user-friendly interface and provide the results in a convenient graphical form. The Promoter Classifier package is an effective tool for various basic manipulations with eukaryotic promoter sequences that usually are necessary for analysis of large promoter datasets. The program Promoter Divider is described in more detail as a representative component of the package.},

	Abstract = {Downstream elements are a newly appreciated class of core promoter elements of RNA polymerase II-transcribed genes. The downstream core element (DCE) was discovered in the human beta-globin promoter, and its sequence composition is distinct from that of the downstream promoter element (DPE). We show here that the DCE is a bona fide core promoter element present in a large number of promoters and with high incidence in promoters containing a TATA motif. Database analysis indicates that the DCE is found in diverse promoters, supporting its functional relevance in a variety of promoter contexts. The DCE consists of three subelements, and DCE function is recapitulated in a TFIID-dependent manner. Subelement 3 can function independently of the other two and shows a TFIID requirement as well. UV photo-cross-linking results demonstrate that TAF1/TAF(II)250 interacts with the DCE subelement DNA in a sequence-dependent manner. These data show that downstream elements consist of at least two types, those of the DPE class and those of the DCE class; they function via different DNA sequences and interact with different transcription activation factors. Finally, these data argue that TFIID is, in fact, a core promoter recognition complex.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: The subject of our paper is bioinformatics analysis of the distinguishing features of human promoter DNA sequences, in particular of synergetic combinations of core promoter elements therein. We suppose that specific scenarios of transcription initiation are essentially related to various particular implementations of the interaction of basal transcription machinery with promoter DNA, depending on the presence and mutual positioning of core promoter elements.
RESULTS: In addition to the combinations of core promoter elements previously experimentally confirmed [TATA box and Initiator (Inr), Downstream Promoter Element (DPE) and Inr, and TFIIB recognition element (BRE) and TATA box] we propose other alternate synergetic combinations: BRE and Inr, BRE and DPE, and TATA and DPE with respective models. The suggestion is based on a high statistical significance of the alternate combinations in promoters, comparable with the significance of the known combinations. We also present arguments that the BRE element is statistically more important than previously thought, and suggest possible mechanisms of action of the core elements in the promoters with multiple transcription start sites.

	Abstract = {Despite being one of the first eukaryotic transcriptional regulatory elements identified, the sequence of a native TATA box and its significance remain elusive. Applying criteria associated with TATA boxes we queried several Saccharomyces genomes and arrived at the consensus TATA(A/T)A(A/T)(A/G). Approximately 20% of yeast genes contain a TATA box. Strikingly, TATA box-containing genes are associated with responses to stress, are highly regulated, and preferentially utilize SAGA rather than TFIID when compared to TATA-less promoters. Transcriptional regulation in yeast appears to be mechanistically bipolar, possibly reflecting a need to balance inducible stress-related responses with constitutive housekeeping functions.},

	Abstract = {The structure of the general transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) in a complex with RNA polymerase II reveals three features crucial for transcription initiation: an N-terminal zinc ribbon domain of TFIIB that contacts the "dock" domain of the polymerase, near the path of RNA exit from a transcribing enzyme; a "finger" domain of TFIIB that is inserted into the polymerase active center; and a C-terminal domain, whose interaction with both the polymerase and with a TATA box-binding protein (TBP)-promoter DNA complex orients the DNA for unwinding and transcription. TFIIB stabilizes an early initiation complex, containing an incomplete RNA-DNA hybrid region. It may interact with the template strand, which sets the location of the transcription start site, and may interfere with RNA exit, which leads to abortive initiation or promoter escape. The trajectory of promoter DNA determined by the C-terminal domain of TFIIB traverses sites of interaction with TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH, serving to define their roles in the transcription initiation process.},

Binding of a mismatched nucleoside triphosphate was also detected, but in an adjacent site, inverted with respect to the correctly paired nucleotide. The results are consistent with a two-step mechanism of nucleotide selection, with initial binding to an entry (E) site beneath the active center in an inverted orientation, followed by rotation into the nucleotide addition (A) site for pairing with the template DNA. This mechanism is unrelated to that of single subunit RNA polymerases and so defines a new paradigm for the large, multisubunit enzymes. Additional findings from these studies include a third nucleotide binding site that may define the length of backtracked RNA; DNA double helix unwinding in advance of the polymerase active center; and extension of the diffraction limit of RNA polymerase II crystals to 2.3 A.},

X-ray crystallography has revealed the structure of RNA polymerase II, in the act of transcription, at atomic resolution. Extension of this analysis has shown how nucleotides undergo selection, polymerization, and eventual release from the transcribing complex.

Rather, it correlates with reduced transcriptional induction of genes involved in DNA repair, suggesting that the E3 Ub ligase activity of TFIIH mediates the transcriptional response to DNA damage.},

The basic requirements for a ligand to form a monolayer protecting a gold cluster were established some time ago for alkanethiolate MPCs, but there has been no such information published for water-soluble MPCs. We identify 6 new ligands capable of forming water-soluble MPCs, as well as 22 water-soluble ligands that fail to form MPCs. Our findings contribute not only to the definition of the requirements for MPC formation but also to the variety of MPCs available for applications in chemistry and biology.},

We find that srb4ts Mediator is defective for the stimulation of basal RNA polymerase II transcription at the restrictive temperature in vitro. Taken together, these findings lead to the suggestion that Mediator is required for basal RNA polymerase II transcription in vivo. On this basis, Mediator is identified as a general transcription factor, comparable in importance to RNA polymerase II and other general factors for the initiation of transcription. The possibility that Mediator serves as an anti-inhibitor, opposing the effects of global negative regulators, is largely excluded.},

	Abstract = {A general method of rigid, specific labeling of proteins with gold clusters has been devised. The method relies on the conjugation of a glutathione monolayer-protected gold cluster (MPC) with a single chain Fv antibody fragment (scFv), mutated to present an exposed cysteine residue. Efficient formation of a gold-thiolate bond between the MPC and scFv depends on activation of the gold cluster by chemical oxidation. Once formed, the MPC-scFv conjugate is treated with a reductant to quench cluster reactivity. The procedure has been performed with an MPC with an average Au(71) core and an scFv directed against a tetrameric protein, the influenza neuraminidase. A complex of the MPC-scFv conjugate with the neuraminidase was isolated, and the presence of four gold clusters was verified by cryoelectron microscopy.},

Electron microscopy and single-particle analysis identify this complex as the Mediator head module. The recombinant head module complements "headless" Mediator for the initiation of transcription in vitro. The module interacts with an RNA polymerase II-TFIIF complex, but not with the polymerase or TFIIF alone. This interaction is lost in the presence of a DNA template and associated RNA transcript, recapitulating the release of Mediator that occurs upon the initiation of transcription. Disruption of the head module in a temperature-sensitive mutant in vivo leads to the release of middle and tail modules from a transcriptionally active promoter. The head module evidently controls Mediator-RNA polymerase II and Mediator-promoter interactions.},

Amino acid substitutions within the Pol II TL preferentially alter substrate usage and enzyme fidelity, as does inhibition of transcription by alpha-amanitin. Finally, substitution of His1085 in the TL specifically renders Pol II highly resistant to alpha-amanitin, indicating a functional interaction between His1085 and alpha-amanitin that is supported by rerefinement of an alpha-amanitin-Pol II crystal structure. We propose that alpha-amanitin-inhibited Pol II elongation, which is slow and exhibits reduced substrate selectivity, results from direct alpha-amanitin interference with the TL.},

A structure of a RSC-nucleosome complex with a nucleosome determined by cryo-EM shows the nucleosome bound in a central RSC cavity. Extensive interaction of RSC with histones and DNA seems to destabilize the nucleosome and lead to an overall ATP-independent rearrangement of its structure. Nucleosomal DNA appears disordered and largely free to bulge out into solution as required for remodeling, but the structure of the RSC-nucleosome complex indicates that RSC is unlikely to displace the octamer from the nucleosome to which it is bound. Consideration of the RSC-nucleosome structure and published biochemical information suggests that ATP-dependent DNA translocation by RSC may result in the eviction of histone octamers from adjacent nucleosomes.},

Comparison with the previous structure of the enzyme from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals differences in regions implicated in start site selection and transcription factor interaction. These aspects of the transcription mechanism differ between S. pombe and S. cerevisiae, but are conserved between S. pombe and humans. Amino acid changes apparently responsible for the structural differences are also conserved between S. pombe and humans, suggesting that the S. pombe structure may be a good surrogate for that of the human enzyme.},

	Abstract = {The histone chaperone Vps75 forms a complex with, and stimulates the activity of, the histone acetyltransferase Rtt109. However, Vps75 can also be isolated on its own and might therefore possess Rtt109-independent functions. Analysis of epistatic miniarray profiles showed that VPS75 genetically interacts with factors involved in transcription regulation whereas RTT109 clusters with genes linked to DNA replication/repair. Additional genetic and biochemical experiments revealed a close relationship between Vps75 and RNA polymerase II. Furthermore, Vps75 is recruited to activated genes in an Rtt109-independent manner, and its genome-wide association with genes correlates with transcription rate. Expression microarray analysis identified a number of genes whose normal expression depends on VPS75. Interestingly, histone H2B dynamics at some of these genes are consistent with a role for Vps75 in histone H2A/H2B eviction/deposition during transcription. Indeed, reconstitution of nucleosome disassembly using the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler Rsc and Vps75 revealed that these proteins can cooperate to remove H2A/H2B dimers from nucleosomes. These results indicate a role for Vps75 in nucleosome dynamics during transcription, and importantly, this function appears to be largely independent of Rtt109.},

We report here the crystal structure of RNA polymerase II in the third state, the reverse translocated, or "backtracked" state. The defining feature of the backtracked structure is a binding site for the first backtracked nucleotide. This binding site is occupied in case of nucleotide misincorporation in the RNA or damage to the DNA, and is termed the "P" site because it supports proofreading. The predominant mechanism of proofreading is the excision of a dinucleotide in the presence of the elongation factor SII (TFIIS). Structure determination of a cocrystal with TFIIS reveals a rearrangement whereby cleavage of the RNA may take place.},

A new crystal structure of the same complex at 3.8 angstrom resolution obtained under different solution conditions is complementary with the previous one, revealing the carboxyl-terminal region of TFIIB, located above the polymerase active center cleft, but showing none of the B finger.

	Abstract = {Results from biochemical and structural studies of the RSC chromatin-remodeling complex prompt a proposal for the remodeling mechanism: RSC binding to the nucleosome releases the DNA from the histone surface and initiates DNA translocation (through one or a small number of DNA base pairs); ATP binding completes translocation, and ATP hydrolysis resets the system. Binding energy thus plays a central role in the remodeling process. RSC may disrupt histone-DNA contacts by affecting histone octamer conformation and through extensive interaction with the DNA. Bulging of the DNA from the octamer surface is possible, and twisting is unavoidable, but neither is the basis of remodeling.},

@article{Huang:2010aa,
	Abstract = {A structurally conserved element, the trigger loop, has been suggested to play a key role in substrate selection and catalysis of RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcription elongation. Recently resolved X-ray structures showed that the trigger loop forms direct interactions with the beta-phosphate and base of the matched nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) through residues His1085 and Leu1081, respectively. In order to understand the role of these two critical residues in stabilizing active site conformation in the dynamic complex, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the wild-type pol II elongation complex and its mutants in explicit solvent. In the wild-type complex, we found that the trigger loop is stabilized in the "closed" conformation, and His1085 forms a stable interaction with the NTP. Simulations of point mutations of His1085 are shown to affect this interaction; simulations of alternative protonation states, which are inaccessible through experiment, indicate that only the protonated form is able to stabilize the His1085-NTP interaction. Another trigger loop residue, Leu1081, stabilizes the incoming nucleotide position through interaction with the nucleotide base. Our simulations of this Leu mutant suggest a three-component mechanism for correctly positioning the incoming NTP in which (i) hydrophobic contact through Leu1081, (ii) base stacking, and (iii) base pairing work together to minimize the motion of the incoming NTP base. These results complement experimental observations and provide insight into the role of the trigger loop on transcription fidelity.},

The results are compared to calculations for a model cluster Au(102)(SMe)(44) based on the time-dependent density functional theory in the linear-response regime and using the known structure of Au(102)(p-MBA)(44). The measured and calculated molar absorption coefficients in the NIR-vis region are comparable, within a factor of 2, in the absolute scale. Several characteristic features are observed in the absorption in the range of 1.5-3.5 eV. The onset of the electronic transitions in the mid-IR region is experimentally observed at 0.45 $\pm$ 0.05 eV which compares well with the lowest calculated transition at 0.55 eV. Vibrations in the ligand layer give rise to fingerprint IR features below the onset of low-energy metal-to-metal electronic transitions. Partial exchange of the p-MBA ligand to glutathione does not affect the onset of the electronic transitions, which indicates that the metal core of the cluster is not affected by the ligand exchange. The full spectroscopic characterization of the Au(102)(p-MBA)(44) reported here for the first time gives benchmarks for further studies of manipulation and functionalization of this nanocluster to various applications.},

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mediator comprises 25 subunits with a total mass of more than one megadalton (refs 5, 6) and is organized into three modules, called head, middle/arm and tail. Our understanding of Mediator assembly and its role in regulating transcription has been impeded so far by limited structural information. Here we report the crystal structure of the essential Mediator head module (seven subunits, with a mass of 223 kilodaltons) at a resolution of 4.3 {\aa}ngstr{\"o}ms. Our structure reveals three distinct domains, with the integrity of the complex centred on a bundle of ten helices from five different head subunits. An intricate pattern of interactions within this helical bundle ensures the stable assembly of the head subunits and provides the binding sites for general transcription factors and Pol II. Our structural and functional data suggest that the head module juxtaposes transcription factor IIH and the carboxy-terminal domain of the largest subunit of Pol II, thereby facilitating phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal domain of Pol II. Our results reveal architectural principles underlying the role of Mediator in the regulation of gene expression.},

	Abstract = {The initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II is a multistage process. X-ray crystal structures of transcription complexes containing short RNAs reveal three structural states: one with 2- and 3-nucleotide RNAs, in which only the 3'-end of the RNA is detectable; a second state with 4- and 5-nucleotide RNAs, with an RNA-DNA hybrid in a grossly distorted conformation; and a third state with RNAs of 6 nucleotides and longer, essentially the same as a stable elongating complex. The transition from the first to the second state correlates with a markedly reduced frequency of abortive initiation. The transition from the second to the third state correlates with partial "bubble collapse" and promoter escape. Polymerase structure is permissive for abortive initiation, thereby setting a lower limit on polymerase-promoter complex lifetime and allowing the dissociation of nonspecific complexes. Abortive initiation may be viewed as promoter proofreading, and the structural transitions as checkpoints for promoter control.},

Consistency among all the structures establishes the location of the "minimal core" subunits (Ssl1, Tfb1, Tfb2, Tfb4, and Tfb5), and additional densities can be specifically attributed to Rad3, Ssl2, and the TFIIK trimer. These results can be further interpreted by placement of previous X-ray structures into the additional densities to give a preliminary picture of the RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex. In this picture, the key catalytic components of TFIIH, the Ssl2 ATPase/helicase and the Kin28 protein kinase are in proximity to their targets, downstream promoter DNA and the RNA polymerase C-terminal domain.},

Tfb6 dissociates from TFIIH as a heterodimer with the Ssl2 subunit, a DNA helicase that drives promoter melting for the initiation of transcription.

@article{Larson:2012aa,
	Abstract = {During transcription, RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) must select the correct nucleotide, catalyze its addition to the growing RNA transcript, and move stepwise along the DNA until a gene is fully transcribed. In all kingdoms of life, transcription must be finely tuned to ensure an appropriate balance between fidelity and speed. Here, we used an optical-trapping assay with high spatiotemporal resolution to probe directly the motion of individual RNAPII molecules as they pass through each of the enzymatic steps of transcript elongation. We report direct evidence that the RNAPII trigger loop, an evolutionarily conserved protein subdomain, serves as a master regulator of transcription, affecting each of the three main phases of elongation, namely: substrate selection, translocation, and catalysis. Global fits to the force-velocity relationships of RNAPII and its trigger loop mutants support a Brownian ratchet model for elongation, where the incoming NTP is able to bind in either the pre- or posttranslocated state, and movement between these two states is governed by the trigger loop. Comparison of the kinetics of pausing by WT and mutant RNAPII under conditions that promote base misincorporation indicate that the trigger loop governs fidelity in substrate selection and mismatch recognition, and thereby controls aspects of both transcriptional accuracy and rate.},

The resulting complete pol II transcription preinitiation complex (PIC) contained equimolar amounts of all 31 protein components. An intermediate in assembly, consisting of four GTFs and promoter DNA, could be isolated and supplemented with the remaining components for formation of the PIC. Nuclease digestion and psoralen cross-linking mapped the PIC between positions -70 and -9, centered on the TATA box. Addition of ATP to the PIC resulted in quantitative conversion to an open complex, which retained all 31 proteins, contrary to expectation from previous studies. Addition of the remaining NTPs resulted in run-off transcription, with an efficiency that was promoter-dependent and was as great as 17.5% with the promoters tested.},

	Abstract = {Cryoelectron microscopy of vitrified sections has become a powerful tool for investigating the fine structural features of cellular compartments. In the present study, this approach has been applied in order to explore the ultrastructural morphology of the interphase nucleus in different mammalian cultured cells. Rat hepatoma, Chinese hamster ovary and Potorus kidney cells were cryofixed by high-pressure freezing and the cryosections were examined at low temperature by transmission electron microscopy. Our results show that while the contrast of nuclear structural domains is remarkably homogeneous in hydrated sections, some of them can be recognised due to their characteristic texture. Thus, condensed chromatin appears finely granular and the perichromatin region contains rather abundant fibro-granular elements suggesting the presence of dispersed chromatin fibres and of perichromatin fibrils and granules. The interchromatin space looks homogeneous and interchromatin granules have not been identified under these preparative conditions. In the nucleolus, the most striking feature is the granular component, while the other parts of the nucleolar body, which appear less contrasted, are difficult to resolve. The nuclear envelope is easily recognisable with its regular perinuclear space and nuclear pore complexes. Our observations are discussed in the context of results obtained by other, more conventional electron microscopic methods.},

Combined with 3-d reconstruction, it has become an important tool for structural molecular biology. Larger objects such as cells and tissues cannot generally be squeezed in a thin enough film. Cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections (CEMOVIS) provides then a solution. It requires vitrification of a sizable piece of biological material and cutting it into ultrathin sections, which are observed in the vitrified state. Each of these operations raises serious difficulties that have now been overcome. In general, the native state seen with CEMOVIS is very different from what has been seen before and it is seen in more detail. CEMOVIS will give its full potential when combined with computerized electron tomography for 3-d reconstruction.},

The size and shape of the bacteria, as well as their surface and cytoplasmic constituents, were nicely preserved and compared well with other published high-resolution techniques. Cells possessed a rich cytoplasm containing a diffuse dispersion of ribosomes and genetic material. Close examination of cells revealed that the periplasmic space was compressed during cryosectioning, a finding which provided supporting evidence that this space is filled by a compressible gel. Since the outer membrane and peptidoglycan layer are bonded together via lipoproteins, the space between them (although still part of the periplasmic space) was not as compacted. Even when this cryosectioning compression was taken into account, there was still substantial variability in the width of the periplasmic space. It is possible that the protoplast has some capacity to float freely within the periplasm.},

	Abstract = {Direct visualization of the skin barrier formation process by cryotransmission electron microscopy of vitreous epidermal sections has been performed. The results obtained differ in many aspects from those of classical chemical fixation electron microscopy. Here we show that (i) a new "organelle or branched tubular structure" containing nonlamellar or partly lamellar material, and closely corresponding in numbers, dimensions, and localization to lamellar bodies of classical chemical fixation electron micrographs, and (ii) a new "ribosome complex-like structure", not preserved in classical electron micrographs, are omnipresent at apparent active sites of skin barrier formation. Evidence that skin barrier formation may not take place via extensive membrane fusion involving discrete lamellar bodies, but rather by a morphologically continuous membrane folding process are: (i) the often clearly nonlamellar content of structures corresponding to lamellar bodies with concomitant visualization of multilamellar membrane structures of the intercellular space; (ii) the "multifolded" appearance of the lipid matrix of the intercellular space; and (iii) the identification of extended "intracellular" multilamellar continuous structures with an optical density profile closely corresponding to that of the lipid matrix of the intercellular space. Based on the cryo-electron microscopic data presented in this study we propose that a membrane transition from cubic-like to multilamellar may take place already inside the "tubuloreticular cisternal membrane system" of upper granular cells recently reported by Elias et al.},

	Abstract = {Beam damage is the main resolution-limiting factor when biological particles are observed by cryoelectron microscopy in a thin vitrified solution film. Furthermore, the low contrast of the specimen frequently makes observation difficult and limits the possibility of image processing. Cryo-negative staining, in which the particles are vitrified in a thin layer of concentrated ammonium molybdate solution, makes it possible to visualize the particles with a much better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) while keeping the specimen in a good state of preservation. We have observed the Escherichia coli GroEL chaperonin, prepared in a native vitrified solution and by cryo-negative staining after electron exposure from 1000 to 3000e(-)/nm(2). We have compared the resulting three-dimensional models obtained from these different conditions and have tested their fit with the atomic model of the protein subunit obtained from X-ray crystallography. It is found that, down to 1.5-nm resolution, the particles appear to be faithfully represented in the cryo-negatively stained preparation, but there is an approximately 10-fold increase of SNR compared with the native vitrified preparation. Furthermore, for the same range of irradiation and down to the same resolution, the particles seem unaffected by beam damage, whereas the damage is severe in the native vitrified particles.},

	Abstract = {Nonpretreated high pressure frozen samples of Zea mays, cartilage and human erythrocytes were cryosectioned and observed at 110K in a cryoelectron microscope. Changes induced by medium doses of electron irradiation (< 10 ke nm-2) are described. After some ke nm-2, the most conspicuous cutting artefacts are erased to a large extent and the visibility of the cell organelles is improved. The sections, compressed in the cutting direction by the sectioning process, shrink once more, in the same direction, when irradiated. This shrinkage depends on the section support and on how the section is adsorbed to it. Shrinkage is not uniform: it is most pronounced in mitochondria, condensed chromatin and nucleolus. This differential shrinkage improves the visibility of major structures on the section and, as a result, 'nicer' images are recorded. However, this apparent improvement is a beam-induced artefact that must be paired with a loss of high resolution information.},

@article{Adrian:1998aa,
	Abstract = {A procedure is presented for the preparation of thin layers of vitrified biological suspensions in the presence of ammonium molybdate, which we term cryo-negative staining. The direct blotting of sample plus stain solution on holey carbon supports produces thin aqueous films across the holes, which are routinely thinner than the aqueous film produced by conventional negative staining on a continuous carbon layer. Because of this, a higher than usual concentration of negative stain (ca. 16% rather than 2%) is required for cryo-negative staining in order to produce an optimal image contrast. The maintenance of the hydrated state, the absence of adsorption to a carbon film and associated sample flattening, together with reduced stain granularity, generates high contrast cryo-images of superior quality to conventional air-dry negative staining. Image features characteristic of unstained vitrified cryo-electron microscopic specimens are present, but with reverse contrast. Examples of cryo-negative staining of several particulate biological samples are shown, including bacteriophage T2, tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), bovine liver catalase crystals, tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV), turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV), keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) types 1 and 2, the 20S proteasome from moss and the E. coli chaperone GroEL. Densitometric quantitation of the mass-density of cryo-negatively stained bacteriophage T2 specimens before and after freeze-drying within the TEM indicates a water content of 30% in the vitreous specimen. Determination of the image resolution from cryo-negatively stained TMV rods and catalase crystals shows the presence of optical diffraction data to ca. 10 A and 11.5 A, respectively. For cryo-negatively stained vitrified catalase crystals, electron diffraction shows that atomic resolution is preserved (to better than 20 diffraction orders and less than 3 A). The electron diffraction resolution is reduced to ca. 10 A when catalase crystal specimens are prepared without freezing or when they are freeze-dried in the electron microscope. Thin vitrified films of TMV, TBSV and TYMV in the presence of 16% ammonium molybdate show a clear indication of two-dimensional (2-D) order, confirmed by single particle orientational analysis of TBSV and 2-D crystallographic analysis of TYMV. These observations are in accord with earlier claims that ammonium molybdate induces 2-D array and crystal formation from viruses and macromolecules during drying onto mica. Three-dimensional analysis of the TBSV sample using the tools of icosahedral reconstruction revealed that a significant fraction of the particles were distorted. A reconstruction from a subset of undistorted particles produced the characteristic T = 3 dimer clustered structure of TBSV, although the spikes are shortened relative to the structure defined by X-ray crystallography. The 20S proteasome, GroEL, catalase, bacteriophage T2, TMV, TBSV and TYMV all show no indication of sample instability during cryo-negative staining. However, detectable dissociation of the KLH2 oligomers in the presence of the high concentration of ammonium molybdate conforms with existing knowledge on the molybdate-induced dissociation of this molecule. This indicates that the possibility of sample-stain interaction in solution, prior to vitrification, must always be carefully assessed.},

	Abstract = {Although the formation of 30-nm chromatin fibers is thought to be the most basic event of chromatin compaction, it remains controversial because high-resolution imaging of chromatin in living eukaryotic cells had not been possible until now. Cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections is a relatively new technique, which enables direct high-resolution observation of the cell structures in a close-to-native state. We used cryo-electron microscopy and image processing to further investigate the presence of 30-nm chromatin fibers in human mitotic chromosomes. HeLa S3 cells were vitrified by high-pressure freezing, thin-sectioned, and then imaged under the cryo-electron microscope without any further chemical treatment or staining. For an unambiguous interpretation of the images, the effects of the contrast transfer function were computationally corrected. The mitotic chromosomes of the HeLa S3 cells appeared as compact structures with a homogeneous grainy texture, in which there were no visible 30-nm fibers. Power spectra of the chromosome images also gave no indication of 30-nm chromatin folding. These results, together with our observations of the effects of chromosome swelling, strongly suggest that, within the bulk of compact metaphase chromosomes, the nucleosomal fiber does not undergo 30-nm folding, but exists in a highly disordered and interdigitated state, which is, on the local scale, comparable with a polymer melt.},

Promoter DNA was associated only with the GTFs, suspended above the pol II cleft and not in contact with pol II.

	Abstract = {Low-dose electron microscopy of cryo-preserved individual biomolecules (single-particle cryo-EM) is a powerful tool for obtaining information about the structure and dynamics of large macromolecular assemblies. Acquiring images with low dose reduces radiation damage, preserves atomic structural details, but results in low signal-to-noise ratio of the individual images. The projection directions of the two-dimensional images are random and unknown. The grand challenge is to achieve the precise three-dimensional (3D) alignment of many (tens of thousands to millions) noisy projection images, which may then be combined to obtain a faithful 3D map. An accurate initial 3D model is critical for obtaining the precise 3D alignment required for high-resolution (<10 {\AA}) map reconstruction. We report a method (PRIME) that, in a single step and without prior structural knowledge, can generate an accurate initial 3D map directly from the noisy images.},

	Abstract = {The open source software suite SIMPLE: Single-particle IMage Processing Linux Engine provides data analysis methods for single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). SIMPLE addresses the problem of obtaining 3D reconstructions from 2D projections only, without using an input reference volume for approximating orientations. The SIMPLE reconstruction algorithm is tailored to asymmetrical and structurally heterogeneous single-particles. Its basis is global optimization with the use of Fourier common lines. The advance that enables ab initio reconstruction and heterogeneity analysis is the separation of the tasks of in-plane alignment and projection direction determination via bijective orientation search - a new concept in common lines-based strategies. Bijective orientation search divides the configuration space into two groups of paired parameters that are optimized separately. The first group consists of the rotations and shifts in the plane of the projection; the second group consists of the projection directions and state assignments. In SIMPLE, ab initio reconstruction is feasible because the 3D in-plane alignment is approximated using reference-free 2D rotational alignment. The subsequent common lines-based search hence searches projection directions and states only. Thousands of class averages are analyzed simultaneously in a matter of hours. Novice SIMPLE users get a head start via the well documented front-end. The structured, object-oriented back-end invites advanced users to develop new alignment and reconstruction algorithms. An overview of the package is presented together with benchmarks on simulated data. Executable binaries, source code, and documentation are available at http://simple.stanford.edu.},

	Abstract = {Thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase can regulate cell metabolism through redox regulation of disulfide bridges or through removal of H(2)O(2). These two enzymatic functions are combined in NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase C (NTRC), which contains an N-terminal thioredoxin reductase domain fused with a C-terminal thioredoxin domain. Rice NTRC exists in different oligomeric states, depending on the absence or presence of its NADPH cofactor. It has been suggested that the different oligomeric states may have diverse activity. Thus, the redox status of the chloroplast could influence the oligomeric state of NTRC and thereby its activity. We have characterized the oligomeric states of NTRC from barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). This also includes a structural model of the tetrameric NTRC derived from cryo-electron microscopy and single-particle reconstruction. We conclude that the tetrameric NTRC is a dimeric arrangement of two NTRC homodimers. Unlike that of rice NTRC, the quaternary structure of barley NTRC complexes is unaffected by addition of NADPH. The activity of NTRC was tested with two different enzyme assays. The N-terminal part of NTRC was tested in a thioredoxin reductase assay. A peroxide sensitive Mg-protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester (MPE) cyclase enzyme system of the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway was used to test the catalytic ability of both the N- and C-terminal parts of NTRC. The different oligomeric assembly states do not exhibit significantly different activities. Thus, it appears that the activities are independent of the oligomeric state of barley NTRC.},

The Fourier-space formulation enables inclusion of resolution (spatial frequency of the low-pass limit) as a variable that is adjusted in a particle-dependent, self-adaptive manner.

	Abstract = {The mitochondrial protein frataxin plays a central role in mitochondrial iron homeostasis, and frataxin deficiency is responsible for Friedreich ataxia, a neurodegenerative and cardiac disease that affects 1 in 40000 children. Here we present a single-particle reconstruction from cryoelectron microscopic images of iron-loaded 24-subunit oligomeric frataxin particles at 13 and 17 A resolution. Computer-aided classification of particle images showed heterogeneity in particle size, which was hypothesized to result from gradual accumulation of iron within the core structure. Thus, two reconstructions were created from two classes of particles with iron cores of different sizes. The reconstructions show the iron core of frataxin for the first time. Compared to the previous reconstruction of iron-free particles from negatively stained images, the higher resolution of the present reconstruction allowed a more reliable analysis of the overall three-dimensional structure of the 24-meric assembly. This was done after docking the X-ray structure of the frataxin trimer into the EM reconstruction. The structure revealed a close proximity of the suggested ferroxidation sites of different monomers to the site proposed to serve in iron nucleation and mineralization. The model also assigns a new role to the N-terminal helix of frataxin in controlling the channel at the 4-fold axis of the 24-subunit oligomer. The reconstructions show that, together with some common features, frataxin has several unique features which distinguish it from ferritin. These include the overall organization of the oligomers, the way they are stabilized, and the mechanisms of iron core nucleation.},

@article{Sirijovski:2008aa,
	Abstract = {Photosynthetic organisms require chlorophyll and bacteriochlorophyll to harness light energy and to transform water and carbon dioxide into carbohydrates and oxygen. The biosynthesis of these pigments is initiated by magnesium chelatase, an enzyme composed of BchI, BchD, and BchH proteins, which catalyzes the insertion of Mg(2+) into protoporphyrin IX (Proto) to produce Mg-protoporphyrin IX. BchI and BchD form an ATP-dependent AAA(+) complex that transiently interacts with the Proto-binding BchH subunit, at which point Mg(2+) is chelated. In this study, controlled proteolysis, electron microscopy of negatively stained specimens, and single-particle three-dimensional reconstruction have been used to probe the structure and substrate-binding mechanism of the BchH subunit to a resolution of 25A(.) The apo structure contains three major lobe-shaped domains connected at a single point with additional densities at the tip of two lobes termed the "thumb" and "finger." With the independent reconstruction of a substrate-bound BchH complex (BchH.Proto), we observed a distinct conformational change in the thumb and finger subdomains. Prolonged proteolysis of native apo-BchH produced a stable C-terminal fragment of 45 kDa, and Proto was shown to protect the full-length polypeptide from degradation. Fitting of a truncated BchH polypeptide reconstruction identified the N- and C-terminal domains. Our results show that the N- and C-terminal domains play crucial roles in the substrate-binding mechanism.},

	Abstract = {The generation of ab initio three-dimensional (3D) models is a bottleneck in the studies of large macromolecular assemblies by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. We describe here a novel method, in which established methods for two-dimensional image processing are combined with newly developed programs for joint rotational 3D alignment of a large number of class averages (RAD) and calculation of 3D volumes from aligned projections (VolRec). We demonstrate the power of the method by reconstructing an approximately 660-kDa ATP-fueled AAA+ motor to 7.5 A resolution, with secondary structure elements identified throughout the structure. We propose the method as a generally applicable automated strategy to obtain 3D reconstructions from unstained single particles imaged in vitreous ice.},

	Abstract = {CDK8 (cyclin-dependent kinase 8), along with CycC, Med12, and Med13, form a repressive module (the Cdk8 module) that prevents RNA polymerase II (pol II) interactions with Mediator. Here, we report that the ability of the Cdk8 module to prevent pol II interactions is independent of the Cdk8-dependent kinase activity. We use electron microscopy and single-particle reconstruction to demonstrate that the Cdk8 module forms a distinct structural entity that binds to the head and middle region of Mediator, thereby sterically blocking interactions with pol II.},

@article{Cheng:2006aa,
	Abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of the two 8.4 MDa Rapana thomasiana hemocyanin isoforms, RtH1 and RtH2, have been obtained by cryoelectron microscopy of molecules embedded in vitreous ice and single particle image processing. The final 3D structures of the RtH1 and RtH2 didecamers at 19 A and 16 A resolution, respectively, are very similar to earlier reconstructions of gastropodan hemocyanins, revealing structural features such as the obliquely oriented subunits, the five- and two-fold symmetrical axes. Three new interactions are defined; two of them connecting the arch and the wall while the third is formed between the collar and the wall. The collar-wall connection and one of the arch-wall connections are positioned between two individual subunit dimers, while the second arch-wall connection is located between two subunits within the subunit dimer. All three interactions establish connections to the first tier of the wall. Furthermore, for each interaction we have allocated two first tier functional units most likely involved in forming the connections.},
