Building, from the doc:

A CMake build system is provided. This build system has been tested on Mac and Linux using the Intel Fortran Compiler, gfortran 4.9, and NAG Fortran 6.0. It has not been tested on Windows. This CMake based build provides an install target, and exports from both the install location and the build location so that building and using JSON-Fortran in another CMake based project is trivial. To get started with the CMake based build, set the environment variable FC to point to your Fortran compiler, and create a build directory. Then (cmake-gui|ccmake|cmake) /path/to/json-fortran-root to configure, make to build and make install to optionally install. As long as the project is built with CMake, other CMake projects can find it and link against it.


Compilation:

gfortran test1.f90 -L/usr/local/jsonfortran-gnu-6.1.0/lib/ -I/Users/cyrilreboul/gits/json-fortran/build/include/  -o example1 -ljsonfortran
