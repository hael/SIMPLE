\section{About SIMPLE}

\textbf{S}ingle-particle \textbf{IM}age \textbf{P}rocessing \textbf{L}inux \textbf{E}ngine (\href{www.simplecryoem.com}{\textbf{\textcolor{BurntOrange}{SIMPLE}}}) is a program package for cryo-EM image processing, focusing on \textit{ab initio} 3D reconstruction of single-particles with any point-group symmetry. The SIMPLE back-end consists of an object-oriented numerical library written in modern Fortran. The SIMPLE front-end consists of many standalone, interoperable components developed according to the ``Unix toolkit philosophy''.

SIMPLE is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the \href{http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html}{\textbf{\textcolor{BurntOrange}{GNU General Public License}}} as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the license, or (at your option) any later version.

\subsection{What is new in SIMPLE release 2.5?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[--] A new DDD movie pre-processing program \prgname{unblur} that implements motion correction based the same principal strategy as Grigorieff's program (hence the name). There are two important differences: automatic weighting of the frames using a correlation-based M-estimator and stochastic continuous optimisation of the shift parameters. This enables analysis of movies with severe pathologies due to radiation damage or extreme drift.
    \item[--] A new program \prgname{unblur\_tomo} for movie-processing of tomographic tilt-series.
    \item[--] Improved simultaneous 2D alignment and clustering with \prgname{prime2D} using a hybrid extremal/stochastic hill-climbing search approach, Wiener restoration-based CTF correction and acceleration of the search using Hadamard projection matching. It is now possible to generate a sub-nanometer resolution \textit{ab initio} 3D reconstruction from class averages obtained with  \prgname{prime2D} in a about 10 minutes on a laptop (MacBook Pro mid 2015, 2.8 GHz Intel i7, four physical cores).
    \item[--] Improved \textit{ab initio} 3D reconstruction from class averages using stochastic neighbourhood hill-climbing for initialisation of the 3D orientation search, improving the success rate from around 40\% to 90-100\% for more challenging starting model generation problems, executed with program \prgname{ini3D\_from\_cavgs}
    \item[--] Serial CPU code optimisation through data re-organisation and pipelining.
    \item[--] Improved parallel CPU performance through load balancing as well as data and algorithm re-organisation. It is now possible to process data sets of realistic size on laptops or lightweight workstations that cost less than 2,000 USD.
    \item[--] High-level workflows for 2D analysis and initial 3D model generation that automates initialisation, update of search parameters and dynamic down-scaling of the images for improved performance.
\end{itemize}

\section{File Formats}

\subsection{Image File Formats}
SIMPLE supports SPIDER (\texttt{*.spi}) and MRC (\texttt{*.mrc}) formats for image stacks and volumes. The MRC file handling classes are shared with the the FREALIX program for helical reconstruction \citep{Rohou:2014aa}. RELION \citep{Scheres:2012aa} uses the convention that MRC stacks have the suffix \texttt{*.mrcs} and volumes the suffix \texttt{*.mrc}. This is to overcome the annoyance that it is not possible to tell from an MRC file header whether a MRC file is a volume or a stack. With SIMPLE you can select to use either the \texttt{*.mrcs} or \texttt{*.mrc} suffix for stacks. The way that we keep track of whether a file is a volume or stack is via the command line key value. The key-value pairs \texttt{vol1=rec.mrc} and \texttt{vol2=rec2.mrc} refer to volumes whereas the key-value pairs \texttt{stk=ptcls.mrc} and \texttt{stk2=ptcls2.mrc} refer to stacks.

\subsection{SIMPLE Parameter File Format}
The SIMPLE text-files used for parameter input/output use a \texttt{key=value} syntax of the form
\begin{verbatim}
e1=80. e2=100. e3=5.5 x=1.23 y=4.25 dfx=2.56 dfy=2.54 angast=30.5 state=1
\end{verbatim}
to represent per-particle information. Internally, the orientation information is stored in a dynamic hash data structure, which gives the file format high flexibility. Therefore, writing conversion scripts to allow interchange of parameters between SIMPLE and other packages is easy. SIMPLE uses the same conventions as FREALIGN \citep{Grigorieff:2007aa} to represent orientations and CTF parameters. The CTF parameterisation obtained by CTFFIND \citep{Mindell:2003aa} can be directly plugged into SIMPLE, for example by creating a file \texttt{deftab.txt}, looking like
\begin{verbatim}
kv=300 cs=2.7 fraca=0.07 dfx=2.56 dfy=2.76 angast=30.5
kv=300 cs=2.7 fraca=0.07 dfx=3.50 dfy=3.33 angast=60.0
kv=300 cs=2.7 fraca=0.07 dfx=1.98 dfy=2.02 angast=120.5
...
\end{verbatim}
and adding \texttt{deftab=deftab.txt} and \texttt{ctf=yes} to the PRIME command line (if the images are phase-flipped, this should be indicated by \texttt{ctf=flip}). Note that we now include \texttt{kv}, \texttt{cs}, and \texttt{fraca} in the document listing the CTF parameters. Having all the CTF parameters listed per particle allows easy merging of data sets from different microscopes. SIMPLE now implements a wrapper program for CTFFIND version 4.1.X and newer, producing a SIMPLE conforming document by executing CTFFIND in parallel (via \texttt{simple\_distr\_exec prg=ctffind}). If you have obtained CTF parameters with CTFFIND by other means (via RELION, for example) you can provide a plain text file with the two defocus values and the angle of astigmatism to the SIMPLE program \prgname{makedeftab} and it will take care of the formatting and unit conversions for you.

\subsection{Parameter File Conversions}
The \texttt{SIMPLE/scripts} folder contains a perl-script (\texttt{convert\_frealign2simple.pl}) to convert a Frealing parameter file to a SIMPLE parameter file. This is easy, since both software internally use the \href{http://spider.wadsworth.org/spider_doc/spider/docs/euler.html}{\textbf{\textcolor{BurntOrange}{Spider Euler angle convention}}}. Other packages may use other conventions. There's also a \texttt{convert\_relion2simple.pl} for extracting CTF parameters from RELION \texttt{*.star} files and a \texttt{relion2emanbox.pl} script for converting box files obtained with RELION to the EMAN \texttt{*.box} format used by SIMPLE.

\section{Installation Instructions}

\subsection{System requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[--] Linux (we use Ubuntu 15.04 and above)
	\item[--] MacOSX: 10.10 and above
	\item[--] CMake 3.2 and above
	\item[--] FFTW 3.3 and above
	\item[--] GNU toolchain (gcc \& gfortran) 4.9 to 5.4
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Installation}
\noindent{}\textbf{Step 1:} Create the directory in which you are going to install SIMPLE (referred to here as \texttt{<simple\_path>})

\begin{verbatim}
        @!#> mkdir <simple_path>
\end{verbatim}

\noindent{}\textbf{Step 2:} Unzip the SIMPLE 2.5 tar ball in this directory (assuming you have downloaded the tar ball in the \texttt{<downloads>} directory)

\begin{verbatim}
        @!#> mv <downloads>/SIMPLE2.5.tgz <simple path>
        @!#> cd <simple path>
        @!#> tar -xzf SIMPLE2.5.tgz
\end{verbatim}

\noindent{}\textbf{Step 3:} Create a directory for the build

\begin{verbatim}
        @!#> cd simple2.5
        @!#> mkdir build
        @!#> cd build
\end{verbatim}

\noindent{}\textbf{Step 4:} Compile and install SIMPLE 2.5

\begin{verbatim}
        @!#> cmake ../
        @!#> make -j install
\end{verbatim}

\noindent{}This will install SIMPLE in the \texttt{'build'} directory, clean out all unnecessary
files and will finish with the following message (a reminder for step 5 below):

\begin{verbatim}
Installation complete.
==========================================================================
Please ensure the following variables are set properly in add2.*rc file:
    SIMPLE_EMAIL SIMPLE_QSYS SIMPLE_PATH SIMPLE_SOURCE_PATH
To use SIMPLE, append the relevant add2.* to your HOME shell rc file:
  bash$ cat add2.bashrc >> ~/.bashrc
  tcsh$ cat add2.tcshrc >> ~/.tcshrc
==========================================================================
For minimal installation to work correctly add:
<your src path>/Simple-release/build/bin and
<your src path>/Simple-release/build/scripts
to your PATH environment variable.
==========================================================================
\end{verbatim}

\noindent{}When the build and installation directories are the same (default) and you are
happy with the install, you may want to clean compilation-generated and
unnecessary files using \texttt{distclean}.

\begin{verbatim}
        @!#> make distclean
\end{verbatim}

\noindent{}If you wish to provide an alternative installation directory, substitute step 4 with

\begin{verbatim}
        @!#> cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<alternative directory> ../
        @!#> make -j install
\end{verbatim}

\noindent{}Step 4 assumes that gcc/gfortran and FFTW are installed in fairly standard directories on your machine. In case you have a 
more exotic setup you can provide the paths pointing to your custom gcc/gfortran \& FFTW by substituting step 4 with

\begin{verbatim}
        @!#> FC=<gcc/gfortran path> FFTW_DIR=<FFTW path> cmake ../
        @!#> make -j install
\end{verbatim}

\noindent{}For instance, on MacOS:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[--] Macports users may use: FC=/opt/local/bin/gfortran FFTW\_DIR=/opt/local;
	\item[--] Fink users: FC=/sw/bin/gfortran FFTW\_DIR=/sw/; and
	\item[--] Homebrew users: FC=/usr/local/bin/gfortran FFTW\_DIR=/usr/local/
\end{itemize}

\noindent{}\\\textbf{Step 5:} Set the environment variables.

\noindent{}\\To run SIMPLE, the bin and scripts paths need to be in the \texttt{PATH} environment
variable. The \texttt{SIMPLE\_PATH} environment variable must also be defined. The 
shell scripts \texttt{add2.bashrc} and \texttt{add2.tcshrc} containing the necessary
instructions were generated during the build step. For immediate use for running and testing, execute
\begin{verbatim}
    @!#> source add2.bashrc
\end{verbatim}
\noindent{}or, for TCSH/CSH users:
\begin{verbatim}
    @!#> source add2.tcshrc
\end{verbatim}

\noindent{}For permanent installation \texttt{BASH} users should add the contents of \texttt{add2.bashrc} to your \texttt{<HOME>/.bashrc}
\begin{verbatim}
    @!#> cat add2.bashrc >> ~/.bashrc
\end{verbatim}
\noindent{}or for TCSH/CSH users:
\begin{verbatim}
    @!#> cat add2.tcshrc >> ~/.tcshrc
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Testing the Build}

\noindent{}To ensure that SIMPLE has been correctly installed, we recommend running the application \texttt{simple\_test\_install}. It will test the most 
important components in the SIMPLE library  (those used by prime2D and  prime3D). Execute

\begin{verbatim}
        @!#> simple_test_install 
\end{verbatim}

\noindent{}The program will create its own folder \texttt{SIMPLE\_TEST\_INSTALL*date*} where temporary files and information about each 
test are stored. Upon succesful completion you should see

\begin{verbatim}
        @!#> **** SIMPLE_TEST_INSTALL NORMAL STOP ****
\end{verbatim}

\noindent{}\texttt{simple\_test\_install} can be executed anywhere. After execution, the folder created can be safely removed. If any of the individual 
tests fail an error message will be displayed. If you detect an error, please carefully check the SIMPLE and FFTW installations 
and the gfortran version. If you still have issues, please file a help ticket on the webpage.

\subsection{Installation/Configuration on a Linux Cluster}

Installation on a Linux cluster is essentially the same as on a Linux workstation with the exception that the appropriate modules need to be loaded before installation and execution. On a typical SLURM cluster
\begin{verbatim}
        @!#> module load fftw/3.3.4-gcc
        @!#> module load gcc/4.9.1
\end{verbatim}
The instructions for how to execute SIMPLE in distributed environments (clusters or workstations with more than one CPU socket) are described below \label{distr}.

\section{SIMPLE Usage}

\subsection{SIMPLE Help Tools}
In attempt to reduce the dependency on the manual, we have packaged a lot of the documentation in the software itself. For example
\begin{verbatim}
@!#> simple_exec prg=list
automask2D
automask3D
binarise
boxconvs
cavgassemble
cenvol
check2D_conv
check3D_conv
...
\end{verbatim}
lists all programs executed with \texttt{simple\_exec} (shared-memory parallelisation) and
\begin{verbatim}
@!#> simple_distr_exec prg=list

\end{verbatim}
lists all distributed workflows executed with \texttt{simple\_distr\_exec}. If you don't quite remember which program you are looking for but remember that it was called \texttt{prime} something, you could execute
\begin{verbatim}
@!#> simple_distr_exec prg=list | grep prime
prime2D
prime3D

\end{verbatim}
If you want a description for a particular program, for example \prgname{prime2D}, execute

\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Execution of SIMPLE}
SIMPLE is executed primarily via \texttt{simple\_distr\_exec} that implements higher level workflows intended for distributed execution on workstations and clusters using a hybrid parallelisation model (distributed \textit{and} shared memory). SIMPLE can also be executed via \texttt{simple\_exec}, which implements all individual SIMPLE programs and runs in shared-memory parallelisation mode. Please, beware that the high-level workflows (\prgname{prime2D} and \prgname{ini3D\_from\_cavgs}, for example) can \textit{only} be executed via the distributed execution route. In cluster environments using a job scheduler (PBS, SLURM and SGE are supported by SIMPLE) the file \texttt{simple\_distr\_config.env} in the current working directory controls the execution.
\begin{verbatim}
bash-3.2$ cat simple_distr_config.env 
# CONFIGURATION FILE FOR DISTRIBUTED SIMPLE EXECUTION

# ABSOLUTE PATH TO SIMPLE ROOT DIRECTORY
simple_path           = /scratch/m3earlyadopters/simple/simple/

# ESTIMATED TIME PER IMAGE (IN SECONDS)
time_per_image        = 600

# USER DETAILS
user_account          = el85 
user_email            = hans.elmlund@monash.edu
user_project          = 

# QSYS DETAILS (qsys_name=<local|slurm|pbs>)
qsys_name             = slurm
qsys_partition        = m3a
qsys_qos              =
qsys_reservation      = simple

# JOB DETAILS
job_ntasks            = 1
job_memory_per_task   = 48000
job_name              = taf-dna-part2
job_ntasks_per_socket = 1
\end{verbatim}
This file is auto-generated on workstations, but it needs to be edited by the user in cluster environments. If you need help configuring distributed SIMPLE execution, please file a help ticket on the webpage. The two most important parameters for distributed execution is the number of partitions \texttt{nparts} and the number of shared-memory CPU threads \texttt{nthr}. A rule of thumb for good performance on multi-socket workstations is to minimise the number of parts and maximising the number of threads subject to never having fewer parts than sockets. The shared memory parallelisation does not benefit from the use of a larger number of threads than the number of logical threads available on a socket. To check the number of processors on a linux system, execute \texttt{nproc} in the terminal. Consider a heterogeneous cluster with N nodes, two CPU sockets per node and six CPUs per socket.
\begin{SCfigure}[][h]
\includegraphics[keepaspectratio=true,scale=0.6]{../CPUtopo/cputopo}
\caption{\textbf{Configuration of the parallel PRIME-2D/3D execution on a heterogeneous cluster.} We here represent the nodes in  a heterogeneous cluster by two sockets with six CPUs each and 32Gb RAM/node. The best performance of PRIME--2D/3D is going to be obtained by partitioning  the jobs into \texttt{npart=2N} partitions, where \texttt{N} is the number of nodes. Each partition will then execute six threads \texttt{nthr=6} and these six threads will get access to half the RAM on the node (\texttt{memory=16000}) because we have two sockets per node that need to share the RAM between them}
\end{SCfigure}
If you are unsure how to configure your SIMPLE execution please file a help ticket.

We normally let \prgname{simple\_distr\_exec} run in the background on the login node of our cluster. An example of how to distribute \prgname{prime2D} using ten nodes is provided below.
\begin{verbatim}
@!#> nohup simple_distr_exec prg=prime2D stk=ptcls.mrc smpd=1.77 msk=100
ncls=600 nthr=8 nparts=10 >> PRIME2DOUT &
\end{verbatim}
Another option available on clusters that use the SLURM scheduler is to use the \texttt{srun} command for \prgname{simple\_distr\_exec} via
\begin{verbatim}
@!#> srun --ntasks=1 --ntasks-per-socket=1 --cpus-per-task=1 --mem=32000 
--time=2-0:0:0 --output=PRIME2DOUT.%j --error=PRIME2DERR.%j
simple_distr_exec prg=prime2D stk=ptcls.mrc smpd=1.77 msk=100
ncls=600 nthr=8 nparts=10 &
\end{verbatim}
However, beta testers have reported that srun job sometimes dies with no warning, possibly because of the low tolerance for network errors. A more robust route may be to use \texttt{sbatch} as follows
\begin{verbatim}
@!#>  sbatch -p MYCLUSTER --wrap="simple_distr_exec prg=prime2D stk=ptcls.mrc 
smpd=1.77 msk=100 ncls=600 nthr=8 nparts=10 >> PRIME2DOUT"
\end{verbatim}
where the \texttt{--wrap} flag automatically generates a bash script for the given command.

\subsection{From Movies to \textit{ab initio} 3D reconstruction}
These steps describe a typical SIMPLE workflow.
\begin{enumerate}
\item DDD (Direct Detector Device) movie alignment and frame-weighting using SIMPLE program \prgname{unblur}, executed with \texttt{simple\_distr\_exec}
\item CTF parameter identification with the SIMPLE program \prgname{ctffind}, wrapping CTFFIND4 \citep{rohou2015ctffind4}, executed with \texttt{simple\_distr\_exec}
\item Particle identification using EMAN2 \citep{Tang:2007aa} to generate \texttt{*.box} files
\item Particle extraction with SIMPLE program \prgname{extract}, executed with \texttt{simple\_exec}
\item 2D analysis using the SIMPLE \prgname{prime2D} distributed workflow, executed with \texttt{simple\_distr\_exec}
\item \textit{Ab initio} 3D reconstruction from class averages using the SIMPLE \prgname{ini3D\_from\_cavgs} distributed workflow, executed with \texttt{simple\_distr\_exec}
\item Mapping of class average selection and 3D class orientations to the particles using SIMPLE program \prgname{map2ptcls}, executed with \texttt{simple\_exec}
\item Reconstruction of a 3D map from the individual particle images with SIMPLE program \prgname{recvol}, executed with \texttt{simple\_distr\_exec}
\item Map refinement will be part of release 3.0
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Distributed Workflow: \prgname{prime3D}}
\label{prime3D}
\prgname{prime3D} is a distributed workflow for ab inito reconstruction/refinement based on probabilistic projection matching. PRIME is short for PRobabilistic Initial 3D Model generation for Single-particle cryo-Electron microscopy. There are a daunting number of options in PRIME3D. If you are processing class averages we recommend that you instead use the simple\_distr\_exec prg=ini3D\_from\_cavgs route for executing PRIME3D. Automated workflows for single- and multi-particle refinement using prime3D are planned for the next release (3.0)

\prgname{prime3D\_init} is a distributed workflow for generating a random initial model for initialisation of PRIME3D. If the data set is large (>5000 images), generating a random model can be slow. To speedup, set nran to some smaller number, resulting in nran images selected randomly for reconstruction

\subsection{Distributed Workflow: \prgname{recvol}}
\label{recvol}
\prgname{recvol} is a distributed workflow for reconstructing volumes from MRC and SPIDER stacks, given input orientations and state assignments. The algorithm is based on direct Fourier inversion with a Kaiser-Bessel (KB) interpolation kernel. This window function reduces the real-space ripple artifacts associated with direct moving windowed-sinc interpolation. The feature sought when implementing this algorithm was to enable quick, reliable reconstruction from aligned individual particle images. mul is used to scale the origin shifts if down-sampled were used for alignment and the original images are used for reconstruction. ctf=yes or ctf=flip turns on the Wiener restoration. If the images were phase-flipped set ctf=flip. amsklp, mw, and edge control the solvent mask: the low-pass limit used to generate the envelope; the molecular weight of the molecule (protein assumed but it works reasonably well also for RNA; slight modification of mw might be needed). The inner parameter controls the radius of the soft-edged mask used to remove the unordered DNA/RNA core of spherical icosahedral viruses

\subsection{Distributed Workflow: \prgname{symsrch}}
\label{symsrch}
\prgname{symsrch} is a distributed workflow for searching for the principal symmetry axis of a volume reconstructed without assuming any point-group symmetry. The program takes as input an asymmetrical 3D reconstruction. The alignment document for all the particle images that have gone into the 3D reconstruction and the desired point-group symmetry needs to be inputted. The 3D reconstruction is then projected in 50 (default option) even directions, common lines-based optimisation is used to identify the principal symmetry axis, the rotational transformation is applied to the inputted orientations, and a new alignment document is produced. Input this document to recvol together with the images and the point-group symmetry to generate a symmetrised map. If you are unsure about the point-group, you should use the compare=yes mode and input the highest conceviable point-group. The program then calculates probabilities for all lower groups inclusive.

\subsection{Distributed Workflow: \prgname{unblur}}

\prgname{unblur} is a distributed workflow for movie alignment or unblurring based the same principal strategy as Grigorieffs program (hence the name). There are two important differences: automatic weighting of the frames using a correlation-based M-estimator and continuous optimisation of the shift parameters. Input is a textfile with absolute paths to movie files in addition to a few input parameters, some of which deserve a comment. If dose\_rate and exp\_time are given the individual frames will be low-pass filtered accordingly (dose-weighting strategy). If scale is given, the movie will be Fourier cropped according to the down-scaling factor (for super-resolution movies). If nframesgrp is given the frames will be pre-averaged in the given chunk size (Falcon 3 movies). If fromf/tof are given, a contiguous subset of frames will be averaged without any dose-weighting applied.

If ndiscrete is set to an integer number > 0, the orientations produced are randomly sampled from the set of ndiscrete quasi-even projection directions, and the in-plane parameters are assigned randomly. If even=yes, then all nptcls orientations are assigned quasi-even projection directions,and random in-plane parameters. If nstates is set to some integer number > 0, then states are assigned randomly .in.[1,nstates]. If zero=yes in this mode of execution, the projection directions are zeroed and only the in-plane parameters are kept intact. If errify=yes and astigerr is defined, then uniform random astigmatism errors are introduced .in.[-astigerr,astigerr]

\subsection{Program: \prgname{orisops}}
\label{orisops}
\prgname{orisops} is a program for analyzing SIMPLE orientation/parameter files (text files containing input parameters and/or parameters estimated by prime2D or prime3D). If only oritab is inputted, there are a few options available. If errify=yes, then the program introduces uniform random angular errors .in.[-angerr,angerr], and uniform origin shift errors .in.[-sherr,sherr], and uniform random defocus errors .in.[-dferr,dferr]. If nstates > 1 then random states are assigned .in.[1,nstates]. If mirr=2d, then the Euler angles in oritab are mirrored according to the relation e1=e1, e2=180.+e2, e3=-e3. If mirr=3d, then the Euler angles in oritab are mirrored according to the relation R=M(M*R), where R is the rotation matrix calculated from the Euler angle triplet and M is a 3D reflection matrix (like a unit matrix but with the 3,3-component sign swapped). If e1, e2, or e3 is inputted, the orientations in oritab are rotated correspondingly. If you input state as well, you rotate only the orientations assigned to state state. If mul is defined, you multiply the origin shifts with mul. If zero=yes, then the shifts are zeroed. If none of the above described parameter are defined, and oritab is still defined, the program projects the 3D orientation into the xy-plane and plots the resulting vector (this is useful for checking orientation coverage)

\subsection{Program: \prgname{projvol}}
\label{projvol}
\prgname{projvol} is a program for projecting a volume using interpolation in Fourier space. Input is a SPIDER or MRC volume. Output is a stack of projection images of the same format as the inputted volume. Projections are generated by extraction of central sections from the Fourier volume and back transformation of the 2D FTs. nspace controls the number of projection images generated with quasi-even projection directions. The oritab parameter allows you to input the orientations that you wish to have your volume projected in. If rnd=yes, random rather than quasi-even projections are generated, trs then controls the halfwidth of the random origin shift. Less commonly used parameters are pgrp, which controls the point-group symmetry c (rotational), d (dihedral), t (tetrahedral), o (octahedral) or i (icosahedral). The point-group symmetry is used to restrict the set of projections to within the asymmetric unit. neg inverts the contrast of the projections. mirr=yes mirrors the projection by modifying the Euler angles. If mirr=x or mirr=y the projection is physically mirrored after it has been generated

\subsection{Program: \prgname{recvol}}
\label{recvol}
\prgname{recvol} is a program for reconstructing volumes from MRC and SPIDER stacks, given input orientations and state assignments. The algorithm is based on direct Fourier inversion with a Kaiser-Bessel (KB) interpolation kernel. This window function reduces the real-space ripple artifacts associated with direct moving windowed-sinc interpolation. The feature sought when implementing this algorithm was to enable quick, reliable reconstruction from aligned individual particle images. mul is used to scale the origin shifts if down-sampled were used for alignment and the original images are used for reconstruction. ctf=yes or ctf=flip turns on the Wiener restoration. If the images were phase-flipped set ctf=flip. amsklp, mw, and edge control the solvent mask: the low-pass limit used to generate the envelope; the molecular weight of the molecule (protein assumed but it works reasonably well also for RNA; slight modification of mw might be needed). The inner parameter controls the radius of the soft-edged mask used to remove the unordered DNA/RNA core of spherical icosahedral viruses

\subsection{Program: \prgname{resrange}}
\label{resrange}
\prgname{resrange} is a program for estimating the resolution range used in the heuristic resolution-stepping scheme in the PRIME3D initial model production procedure. The initial low-pass limit is set so that each image receives ten nonzero orientation weights. When quasi-convergence has been reached, the limit is updated one Fourier index at the time, until PRIME reaches the condition where six nonzero orientation weights are assigned to each image. FSC-based filtering is unfortunately not possible to do in the ab initio 3D reconstruction step, because when the orientations are mostly random, the FSC overestimates the resolution. This program is used internally when executing PRIME in distributed mode. We advise you to check the starting and stopping low-pass limits before executing PRIME3D using this program. The resolution range estimate depends on the molecular diameter, which is estimated based on the box size. If you want to override this estimate, set moldiam to the desired value (in \AA{}). This may be necessary if your images have a lot of background padding. However, for starting model generation it is probably better to clip the images snugly around the particle, because smaller images equal less computation

Input is a cryo-EM map, which we usually generate from a PDB file using EMANs program pdb2mrc. simimgs then projects the volume using Fourier interpolation, adds 20\% of the total noise to the images (pink noise), Fourier transforms them, and multiplies them with astigmatic CTF and B-factor. The images are inverse FTed before the remaining 80\% of the noise (white noise) is added

\prgname{stackops} is a program that provides standard single-particle image processing routines that are applied to MRC or SPIDER stacks. If you want to extract a particular state, give an alignment document (oritab) and set state to the state that you want to extract. If you want to select the fraction of best particles (according to the goal function), input an alignment doc (oritab) and set frac. You can combine the state and frac options. If you want to apply noise to images, give the desired signal-to-noise ratio via snr. If you want to calculate the autocorrelation function of your images set acf=yes. If you want to extract a contiguous subset of particle images from the stack, set fromp and top. If you want to fish out a number of particle images from your stack at random, set nran to some nonzero integer number less than nptcls. With avg=yes the global average of the inputted stack is calculated. If you define nframesgrp to some integer number larger than one averages with chunk sizes of nframesgrp are produced, which may be useful for analysis of dose-fractionated image series. neg inverts the contrast of the images

The alignment document for all the particle images that have gone into the 3D reconstruction and the desired point-group symmetry needs to be inputted. The 3D reconstruction is then projected in 50 (default option) even directions, common lines-based optimisation is used to identify the principal symmetry axis, the rotational transformation is applied to the inputted orientations, and a new alignment document is produced. Input this document to recvol together with the images and the point-group symmetry to generate a symmetrised map.

Input is a textfile with absolute paths to movie files in addition to a few input parameters, some of which deserve a comment. If dose\_rate and exp\_time are given the individual frames will be low-pass filtered accordingly (dose-weighting strategy). If scale is given, the movie will be Fourier cropped according to the down-scaling factor (for super-resolution movies). If nframesgrp is given the frames will be pre-averaged in the given chunk size (Falcon 3 movies). If fromf/tof are given, a contiguous subset of frames will be averaged without any dose-weighting applied.
