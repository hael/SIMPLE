The gray bar color must be replaced
The project history tab unfolds but doesn't fold back if I click a second time (shoudl fold/unfold, right?)

Standard workflow
Extract Particles description: coordinates misspelled

New Job Tab
The Workflow selector needs a margin on top

Import
Does the Directory, File Suffix & Output Filename fields really need info buttons, consider removing
The right margin is not correctly displayed, there is a line that shouldn't be there
Why is there an Optional Argument -> Output Filename ?

Motion Correction and CTF Estimation
Same margin issue on the right-hadn side
Movie List Info button should read: Text file containing a list of movies. Usually produced on import
Sampling Distance info button, should read: Sampling distance of images in A/pixel
Amplitude Contrast info button, shoudl read: Fraction of the amplitude contrast used for fitting CTF
Should probably have a default value for the amplitude contrast as 0.1 so that folks don't give percent


Info button behavior
The info string should be displayed in the vicinity of the input field. The position seems arbitrary and sometimes goes outside the field of view

Extract Particles
With the new structure there should be no need to give any info att all. Just hit the botton and then display something like X partciles extracted to file Y.
When I cancel here I get back to Project History, not to the workflow

Particle Stack File
Info tag should be: Stack file containing extracted particles. Usually produced with extract

Apply CTF Correction
Info tag should be: Indicates CTF status of input images and mode of correction, yes=images have CTF & do Wiener restoration, no=turn off CTF correction, flip=images have been phase-flipped & do Wiener restoration
