Frederic recomendation to finish the installation of the workflow
server engine.

This is a note on how to finish the installation of the Workflow server for
the UNICORE service.

After having started the UNICORE server perform the following steps

that is after

/opt/unicore/server$ ./start.sh 

Finish the setup by doing this.

1.4. Setup

After installation, there are some manual steps needed to integrate the new servers into your UNICORE installation.

Gateway: edit gateway/conf/connections.properties and add the connection data for the workflow server(s). For example,

  WORKFLOW = https://localhost:7700
  SERVORCH = https://localhost:7701

XUUDB: if you chose to use an XUUDB for workflow and service orchestrator, you might have to add entries to the XUUDB to allow users access to the workflow engine. Optionally, you can edit the GCID used by the workflow/servorch servers, so that existing entries in the XUUDB will match.

Registry: if you use access control on the registry (which is recommended!) you need to allow the workflow and servorch services to register themselves in the Registry. The exact procedure depends on how you configured your Registry, please cross-reference the section "Enabling access control" in the Registry manual. If youâ€™re using default certificates and the XUUDB, the required entries can be added as follows.

cd xuudb
bin/admin.sh add REGISTRY <workflow>/conf/workflow.pem nobody server ---> bin/admin.sh add REGISTRY /opt/unicore/server/workflow/workflow/conf/workflow.pem nobody server
bin/admin.sh add REGISTRY <servorch>/conf/servorch.pem nobody server ---> bin/admin.sh add REGISTRY /opt/unicore/server/workflow/servorch/conf/servorch.pem nobody server
