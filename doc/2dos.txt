Edge normalisation on extraction (same as EMAN's edgenorm routine). The average of the boarder pixels must be zero for Fourier transformation.

Consider using the natural logarithm of the power spectrum for CTF fitting rater than the square root. Should improve robustness. (Leave option speckind=sqrt|log)

Consider


* support for doc input to re-extract with shifts from doc
* pipelined pick/extract
* frac parameter for 2D (& consider outlier detection similar to picker)
* dyncls should state=0 the ones that fall below threshold
* extract should set the header right (smpd)
* scaling should set the header right (smpd)
