About SIMPLE

Single-particle IMage Processing Linux Engine is a program package for cryo-EM image processing, focusing on ab initio 3D reconstruction of low-symmetry single-particles. The SIMPLE back-end consists of an object-oriented numerical library written in modern Fortran. The SIMPLE front-end consists of a few standalone, interoperable components developed according to the "Unix toolkit philosophy".

What is new in SIMPLE release 2.1?

Our PRIME (for PRobabilistic Initial Model generation for single-particle cryo-Electron microscopy) code has undergone major revisions. First, we re-cast the original PRIME algorithm into an approach for solving  the problem of Simultaneous 2D Alignment and Clustering (SAC). The PRIME SAC solver, implemented in the program simple_prime2D
    * generates improved 2D class averages from large single-particle cryo-EM datasets
    * can be used in conjunction with simple_prime3D to obtain a reliable 3D starting model in a rapid and unbiased fashion
    * overcomes inherent limitations in widely used clustering approaches, such as initialisation bias and local optimality
    * is many times faster than other widely used approaches
Secondly, the program simple_prime3D implements a revised version of our ab initio 3D reconstruction code that is about 150 times faster than the previously released version. This speedup was accomplished using new theory for fast rotational matching of polar Fourier transforms based on Hadamard products calculated using a re-organised and highly parallelizable data structure. The paper describing this is not yet published, but we have release the code since we anticipate that the massive speedup will have major impacts for our users. For example, less than 10,0000 particles downscaled to about 100x100 pixels can feasibly be processed on a modern laptop equipped with an Intel i5 or i7 processor. We executed an ab initio 3D reconstruction run using PRIME3D on half a million images downscaled to 64x64 pixels in less than 5 hours on a cluster with 224 CPU cores (Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2670 0 @ 2.60GHz).
