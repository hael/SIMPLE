Hi You,

Joe and I have been thinking through the pipelining to 2D and how its going to mesh with the GUI - we have some post-wedding thoughts for you to critique!

1. so we go for the per movie extraction but to aid further steps it would be great to add CTFRES and number of PTCLS per movie to the unidoc

2. the watcher for the trigger number of ptcls extracted to initiate 2D could then trigger a 2D job that reads the separate per movie ptcl stacks into memory, down samples (in memory) and does the chunked 2D without writing out anything until it writes out the final cavgs and params

3. if the 2D oritab then has a "unidoc" stye to it in that each ptcl has an index to which stack file it comes from it would be easy go back at the end of the process and delete out particles that now came from a manual selection of micrographs when we do the big tidy up at the end

4. it would be useful to write out a class-average param file that contained class average identifier and number of particles in it - then the ordering by population could be done as a visualisation thing within the gui rather than a genuine reordering of the stack

I guess I should start by looking at PreProc and adding in the per movie extraction of ptcls and generation of unidoc plus the counter of number of particles (limited by selection criteria)???

Thoughts?
S. & J.
