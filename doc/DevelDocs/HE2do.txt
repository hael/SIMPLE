need to parallelise the volassemble of the different states for het_ensemble
need to test unidoc strategy
need to put ctf flag in unidoc

frameavg -> nframesgroup

nested correlation function in replacement of the shell-weights?
   >> calculate corr, stepping one res elem at the time
weighted multi-resolution state sorting by fitting B-factors?
