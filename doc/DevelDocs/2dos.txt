2DOS
* when automsk is turned on in 2D we must force the next round to search all refs, or it will go to shit
* should be able to start refine=shc without oritab (exhaustive projection matching), needed for heterogeneity
* pgrp compulsory
* deal with CTF on the particle level (ctffind + standalone application, input being microscope params + plain text file with dfx dfy angast, take care of units)
* add rejected dir to simple_select and give possibility to input desired select/reject dirs
* every time we execute simple, append the command line to a simple.log file with a time-stamp
* mailx -s "mail from prime2D" hans.elmlund@monash.edu < from_prime2D
* need to deal with state=0 in heterogeneous processing, autoshrink number of states & bookkeep (evaluate whether to use native numbering or update to sequential)

GPU:
(1) UNBLUR
(2) PRIME2D
(3) PRIME3D

TESTS
* Juha's code (icosahedrality of individual particle images)
* test that the Wiener filter works for initial model generation from particles 
* test so that we can run PRIME2D/PRIME3D in all CTF/refine/eo modes
* evaluate stochastic momentum on the corr level
* evaluate deterministic momentum on the rec level

STREAMING
(1) UNBLUR
(2) asynchronous cavg/vol assemble (to reduce latency between runs)
(3) PRIME2D

CONSIDERATIONS
* same resolution update scheme for prime2D as is in unblur?

EXCEPTION HANDLING
* exception handling class that makes more sensible outputs when running the code in distributed mode
* refs should be included in the mixed formats check
* when nr of commands are not sufficient the error message should tell what is missing
* when eo=yes is set the program should ask for fsc-file if missing & instruct better

WORKFLOWS
* print current time
* run ctffind4.X from within the SIMPLE fortran framework so that we can create higher level pre-processing workflows
* higher level automodes for workflows (stitching workflows together, for example, chain together extract, 2D, 3D)
* restart mode for workflows, i.e. keep a status file that can replace the command line when given startit, should be possible to start from any previous iteration

BACK-END
* read statements must have aX descriptor for strings

COMPILATION
* port to fort
* port to PGI

# DOCUMENTATION
* need to get a html code doc generator in place and fix the doc of every class

# RELATED 2 SCIENCE
* implement tilt test (collaborate with Alex)
* continuous refinement using Cartesian FTs and SO(3 scatter search)
