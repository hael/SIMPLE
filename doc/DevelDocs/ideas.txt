self-validation based on subset refinement, i.e. the subset of particles are selected by some procedure and these are refined fore some iterations and then we match the static set with the refined model and check improvement, if improvement on average: good, particles that do not improve would be problematic ones and if this consistenly happens for a subset, they should be removed
