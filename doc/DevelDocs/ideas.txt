self-validation based on subset refinement, i.e. the subset of particles are selected by some procedure and these are refined fore some iterations and then we match the static set with the refined model and check improvement, if improvement on average: good, particles that do not improve would be problematic ones and if this consistenly happens for a subset, they should be removed

Looks like RAG2D with balancing gives more different class averages. We should compare the view distribution of D:s vs. mine by alignment to the Relion map. That could be the basis for a method paper.

D wants the swap mode implemented again, i.e. no two class avgs allowed to occupy same proj. Simplest strategy: random init that satisfy constraints, SHC as usual but with forbidden orientations
