if you have a qsys not equal to local in your bashrc and there is not env file, it should be autogenerated and the process stop with the advise to update it

should be possible to change the number of classes dynamically when running prime2D in distributed mode, i.e. make sure that the first makecavgs has a remap statement

tracker should set ncunits based on # entries in boxfile automatically

need to reach consensus with the automsking no dynamics/enveloping in 2D but the postproc should report on a suitable mask radius (same logics as for the adamsk)

need to insert a flag METADATFFORM = bin/txt and test before testing the cavger for prime3D with npeaks > 1

self-validation based on subset refinement, i.e. the subset of particles are selected by some procedure and these are refined fore some iterations and then we match the static set with the refined model and check improvement, if improvement on average: good, particles that do not improve would be problematic ones and if this consistenly happens for a subset, they should be removed

D wants the swap mode implemented again, i.e. no two class avgs allowed to occupy same proj. Simplest strategy: random init that satisfy constraints, SHC as usual but with forbidden orientations 

need a class document with class, resolution (frc0143), class rank, class pop, class corr, class weight
