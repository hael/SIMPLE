The first step is to create the key pair on the client machine (there is a good chance that this will just be your computer):

$ ssh-keygen -t rsa

Make a copy of your public key

$ cp id_rsa.pub id_rsa.pub_new_mac

Transfer it to the server that you want to connect to and append it to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

$ cat id_rsa.pub_new_mac >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
