if you have a qsys not equal to local
in your bashrc and there is not env file, it should be autogenerated and
the process stop with the advise to update it

should be possible to change the number of classes dynamically when running
prime2D in distributed mode, i.e. make sure that the first makecavgs has
a remap statement

tracker should set ncunits based on # entries in boxfile automatically

need to reach consensus with the automsking
no dynamics/enveloping in 2D but the postproc should report
on a suitable mask radius (same logics as for the adamsk)

need to insert a flag METADATFFORM = bin/txt and test before testing the cavger for prime3D with npeaks > 1

need to sort extract/compress bug
