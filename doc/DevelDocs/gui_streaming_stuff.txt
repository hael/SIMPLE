### Streaming strategy

decided: 2D stream own program, monitors given directory

ctfres
df_max
df_min

are set in pre-proc & state flag in unidoc controls

modify extract to take the "filter" into account

stream 2D:

montor substacks
when chunksz, merge stacks + params, launch chunk-based 2D
move processed data to new folder
loop

offline chunk combiner
