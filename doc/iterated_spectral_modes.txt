Cryo-EM Image Processing: Iterative Spectral Approach to Blind Deconvolution of Co-existing Structural States

Cryo-EM Image Processing: Ab initio 3D Sorting of Extremely Heterogeneous Particle Populations

Cryo-EM Image Processing: Spectral Weights Accelerate 3D Refinement Convergence


iteratively weighting each resolution shell of every particle image conditioned on the 

input: number of states S (can be VERY large), oritab (from prime3D), N images

initialisation: 
random shell-weights W(i,s,f) (i is particle index, s is state index & f is Fourier index)
S weighted 3D reconstructions
iteration:
re-calculate W(i,s,f)
re-calculate weighted 3D reconstructions
convergence:
when sum((W(t-1)-W(t))**2)/(NS) falls below some threshold

Can we have a step between steps where we compare the different states to each other and merge those where they meet some criterion of being the same ? Would shortcut the process of having to have the ptcls eventually resort to single volume
